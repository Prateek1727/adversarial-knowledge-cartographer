## 💡 Key Insights

### What You Learned:
1. **Configuration matters** - Default settings are for general topics
2. **Question phrasing matters** - Specific questions get specific answers
3. **Source quality matters** - 10 blogs < 30 research papers
4. **Patience matters** - Quality takes time (5-10 min vs 2-3 min)

### What to Remember:
1. **Financial topics need 30-50 sources** (not 10)
2. **Ask for data explicitly** ("returns", "volatility", "analysis")
3. **Check credibility distribution** (should vary, not all same)
4. **Verify conflicts are meaningful** (quantitative disagreements)
5. **NO investment guarantees profit** (always true!)

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Run `switch_config.bat` → OPTIMIZED
2. **Today:** Test with better question format
3. **This Week:** Try other financial topics
4. **Long-term:** Read full improvement guides

## Summary

Your Silver ETF analysis was **poor quality** because:
- ❌ Only 10 sources (need 30-50)
- ❌ All credibility = 0.54 (need 0.45-0.95 range)
- ❌ Only 1 conflict (need 5-10)
- ❌ No quantitative data (need returns, volatility, risks)
- ❌ Doesn't answer question (should say NO to "guarantee profit")

**Fix:** Update config to OPTIMIZED, ask better question, wait 5-10 minutes.

**Result:** 3x more sources, diverse credibility, 7 conflicts, comprehensive data.
