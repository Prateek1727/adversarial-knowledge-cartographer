This review examines coffee's multifaceted impact on health and well-being, drawing on decades of research. Overall, the consensus is that moderate coffee intake is more beneficial than harmful across a wide range of health outcomes. Numerous large-scale, prospective cohort studies from around the world have consistently shown that moderate coffee consumption-typically three to five cups per day-is associated with reduced overall mortality and lower risk of major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, stroke, respiratory conditions, cognitive decline, and potentially several types of cancer, including liver and uterine cancers. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee have shown benefits. The addition of sugar and cream to coffee may attenuate coffee's positive health effects. Despite historical concerns, coffee consumption is not linked to increased risks of cancer, hypertension, or arrhythmia. However, some concerns remain. For pregnant women, coffee consumption should be limited to lower amounts, such that the daily intake of caffeine does not exceed 200 mg/day. Also, excessive caffeinated coffee intake may cause anxiety or sleep disturbances. Coffee's health-promoting mechanisms include improved glucose balancing, increased physical activity, increased fat oxidation, improved lung function, and reduced inflammation. Beyond mortality and chronic diseases, coffee consumption affects many aspects of well-being: it supports hydration, boosts mental acuity, enhances physical performance, and may aid bowel recovery after surgery. While the field is well-studied via long-term observational cohorts, future research should focus on randomized controlled trials, Mendelian randomization studies, and granular analyses of coffee types and additives.\nKeywords: caffeine; cancer risk reduction; cardiovascular mortality; chronic disease prevention; coffee; cognitive decline mitigation; pregnancy and caffeine safety.\nConflict of interest statement\nDr. Kamangar has served as a consultant for the National Coffee Association.

      "content": "Abstract\nBackground: Coffee is a widely available beverage that is enjoyed by individuals of many cultures. The publication of new studies prompts a review of the clinical updates regarding the association between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease.\nMethods: We present a narrative review of the literature related to coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease.\nResults: Recent (2000-2021) studies have shown that regular coffee consumption is associated with a decreased risk of developing hypertension, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. However, results are inconsistent with regard to coffee consumption and risk of developing coronary heart disease. Most studies show a J-shaped association, wherein moderate coffee consumption resulted in decreased risk of coronary heart disease and heavy coffee consumption resulted in increased risk. In addition, boiled or unfiltered coffee is more atherogenic than filtered coffee because of its rich diterpene content that inhibits bile acid synthesis and ultimately affects lipid metabolism. On the other hand, filtered coffee, which is essentially devoid of the aforementioned compounds, exerts antiatherogenic properties by increasing high-density lipoprotein\u2013mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages through the influence of plasma phenolic acid. As such, cholesterol levels are principally influenced by the manner of coffee preparation (boiled vs filtered).\nConclusion: Our findings suggest that moderate coffee consumption leads to a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular-related mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation. However, no conclusive relationship between coffee and coronary heart disease risk has been consistently identified.\nKeywords: Atrial fibrillation, cholesterol, coffee, coronary disease, diterpenes, heart failure, hypertension, lipids, phenolic acid\nINTRODUCTION\nCoffee, one of the most popular beverages in the world, is widely enjoyed regardless of individuals\u2019 ethnicity, sex, or cultural background because of its psychoactive effects, including mental alertness, vigilance, reaction time, and productivity. Its accessibility and extensive consumption have generated great interest regarding its overall impact on health. Concerns have been raised about the ability of coffee to induce cardiac arrhythmias and increase blood pressure.1,2 In the 1960s, coffee consumption was labeled as a cardiovascular risk factor associated with coronary heart disease.3\nAmericans, similar to Europeans, are estimated to consume approximately 5.1 kg of coffee per person per year.4 The amount of caffeine, a major component of coffee, varies between 30 mg and 175 mg in a single home-prepared cup of coffee.4 The stimulant effect of caffeine is caused by the antagonism of adenosine receptors, effectively inhibiting the effects of adenosine, a well-known inhibitory neuromodulator. However, caffeine is not a completely benign compound, as it can cross the placenta during pregnancy and may potentially cause conditions such as spontaneous abortion and impaired fetal growth. Therefore, coffee consumption for females who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should be limited to a moderate level that does not exceed 300 mg of caffeine per day.5\nGiven the publication of recent (2000-2021) studies regarding coffee consumption, we review clinical updates regarding the impact of coffee consumption on cardiovascular health. This review focuses on the association between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality and morbidity.\nMETHODS\nWe conducted a literature search of the PubMed/MEDLINE database for relevant articles using a combination of key terms such as \u201ccoffee,\u201d \u201ccoffee consumption,\u201d \u201ccardiovascular diseases,\u201d \u201chypertension,\u201d \u201ccholesterol,\u201d \u201cmyocardial infarct,\u201d and \u201catrial fibrillation.\u201d We included studies that investigated the association of coffee consumption and various cardiac conditions. This narrative review synthesizes findings from previous research and recent studies on the topic.\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND HYPERTENSION\nA 1999 meta-analysis of clinical trials by Jee et al that included 11 eligible studies (n=522) revealed a direct increased relationship between coffee consumption and blood pressure readings after a 56-day median follow-up.6 An older cohort study by Jenner et al (1988) that included 340 working males aged 20 to 45 years old who were not on any antihypertensive medication for a 6-year period revealed that systolic and diastolic changes in blood pressure were both positively related to baseline age and weight.7 In the Jenner et al study, a reduction in coffee consumption was negatively associated with systolic changes in blood pressure.7\nHowever, more recent studies have reported contrasting findings. A large cohort study (n=8,780) of middle-aged adults from Brazil by Miranda et al (2021) showed that those who consumed moderate (1 to 3 cups per day) amounts of coffee had less risk of developing hypertension than those who never or almost never drank coffee (relative risk [RR]=0.82, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.97, P=0.018).8 Notably, these benefits were only observed in those who had never smoked (RR=0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.98) as opposed to current and former smokers who did not show a statistically significant reduction in relative risk.8 In a pilot crossover randomized study by Revuelta-Iniesta and Al-Dujaili (2014), green coffee was found to significantly reduce systolic blood pressure (P=0.02) by a mean of 2.65 \u00b1 1.37 mm Hg compared to baseline.9\nA 2018 review by Fan et al proposed several possible mechanisms underlying these results: (1) the augmentation of cytochrome P450 1A2 (CYP1A2) activity (the main enzyme for metabolizing caffeine), which is inversely correlated with blood pressure levels in coffee drinkers who are nonsmokers; (2) the inhibition of sodium and water reabsorption; and (3) the inhibition of inflammation, oxidative stress, and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) via chlorogenic acid, which is found in high concentrations in coffee.10 In 2009, the Hypertension and Ambulatory Recording VEnetia STudy (HARVEST) found that the risk of developing hypertension was directly associated with coffee consumption but only in people who possessed the allele CYP1A2 variant for slow metabolizers (59% of the population); whereas in those who were rapid CYP1A2 metabolizers, coffee consumption was inversely related to the risk of developing hypertension.11\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND CHOLESTEROL\nAs stated previously, boiled or unfiltered coffee is more atherogenic than filtered coffee because of its diterpene content. Cafestol and kahweol are 2 diterpenes in coffee beverages, with approximately 7.2 mg of each substance per cup of boiled coffee.12 However, paper-filtering coffee removes most of these oils, with only about 0.02 mg of each substance retained per cup.12-14 Post et al (1997) found that diterpenes inhibit bile acid synthesis which leads to attenuated catabolism of lipids.15 The researchers observed that cafestol suppressed cholesterol 7\u03b1-hydroxylase and sterol 27-hydroxylase in rat hepatocytes, while kahweol had less suppressive effects.15\nBecause boiled coffee is known to have atherogenic capabilities through cafestol and kahweol, filtered coffee that is virtually devoid of these compounds can exert antiatherogenic properties by increasing high-density lipoprotein\u2013mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages through the influence of plasma phenolic acid, another major component in coffee beverages. Uto-Kondo et al (2010) concluded that plasma phenolic acid is capable of increasing ATP-binding cassette transporter ABCG1 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI) expression, which are responsible for high-density lipoprotein\u2013mediated cellular cholesterol efflux.16\nFurthermore, coffee consumption was observed to have a direct linear relationship with total cholesterol levels.17 Researchers later (in 1987 and 1989) found that between unfiltered (boiled) and filtered coffee, only boiled coffee was directly associated with an increase in total cholesterol levels.18,19 A crossover, randomized, controlled study by Sarri\u00e1 et al (2018) of 25 normocholesterolemic and 27 hypercholesterolemic males and females aged 18 to 45 years with body mass index 18 to 25 kg/m2 found significant decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) in both groups, as well as in percentage of body fat (P=0.001) after 3 servings per day of a green/roasted coffee blend, providing 510.6 mg hydroxycinnamic acids and 121.2 mg caffeine per day, vs a control drink (8 weeks each).20 Concurrent significant decreases were seen in leptin (P=0.001), plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (P<0.001), and resistin (P=0.034) levels, as well as glucose concentration (P=0.030), insulin resistance (P=0.011), and triglyceride levels (P= 0.017) in the 2 groups after coffee consumption, with a notably greater reduction in the hypercholesterolemic cohort (group effect, P=0.027).20 Currently, no specific recommendations on the type and ideal amount of coffee consumption take advantage of these findings.\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION, CORONARY HEART DISEASE, AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE\nDespite evidence that cholesterol levels seem to be increased by boiled coffee consumption,18,19 the association with coronary heart disease seems to be different. In a prospective cohort study by Lopez-Garcia et al (2006), groups with varying coffee consumption had insignificant RRs for coronary heart disease.21 However, results across studies are inconsistent. In an Italian study by Grioni et al (2015), the consumption of more than 2 cups per day of Italian-style coffee was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease.12 Additionally, a meta-analysis of 13 case-control and 10 cohort studies by Sofi et al (2007) showed a significant association between high coffee consumption and risk of coronary heart disease in the case-control studies: >4 cups per day (odds ratio [OR] 1.83, 95% CI 1.49 to 2.24, P<0.0001) and 3 to 4 cups per day (OR 1.33, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.71, P<0.0001).22 In the long-term follow-up cohort studies, however, the risk of developing coronary heart disease was insignificant for those drinking >4 cups per day (RR 1.16, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.41, P=0.14), 3 to 4 cups per day (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.22, P=0.57), and \u22642 cups per day (RR 1.04, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.19, P=0.60).22\nIn a study by Rodriguez-Artalejo and L\u00f3pez-Garcia (2018), moderate levels of coffee consumption (3 to 5 cups per day) were associated with a 15% reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease, and higher levels of intake were not shown to increase risk.23 In a study by Zhou and Hypp\u00f6nen (2019), those who did not drink coffee, those who drank decaffeinated coffee, and heavy coffee drinkers (>6 cups per day) had higher odds of developing cardiovascular disease by 11%, 7%, and 22%, respectively (P=0.013) compared to those who consumed 1 to 2 cups of coffee per day.24\nIn a meta-analysis of 17 studies involving 233,617 participants, Mo et al (2018) noted an increase in myocardial infarction among males who consumed >3 cups of coffee per day; this effect was not observed in females.25 Inconsistencies have also been seen among elderly males and females. A study by van Woudenbergh et al (2008) revealed a significant reduction in coronary calcification in elderly (mean age of 64 years) females with moderate (3 to 4 cups per day) and high (>4 cups per day) coffee intake compared to those with a daily intake of \u22643 cups.26 The investigators speculated that the phytoestrogens in coffee could partly replace estrogen stores in postmenopausal females, leading to a decreased incidence of atherosclerosis. This function of phytoestrogen may explain the lack of protective effect of coffee for atherosclerotic calcification in males.26\nCornelis et al (2006) shed some light on why these studies commonly reported a dose-dependent J- or U-shaped curve.27 According to their study, the increased risk of coronary heart disease among boiled (unfiltered) coffee consumers is associated with diterpenes that increase cholesterol levels and ultimately the risk of coronary heart disease. However, Cornelis et al noted that the risk of developing myocardial infarction was not obviated by filtering diterpenoids.27 Variations in CYP1A2 activity among coffee consumers determined the risk of cardiovascular disease, and because CYP1A2 does not metabolize anything else in filtered coffee other than caffeine, the investigators were led to believe that caffeine is the major component of filtered coffee that increases the risk of myocardial infarction. They proposed that the inhibition of the vasodilatory effects of adenosine may play a role in the development of cardiovascular disease. This hypothesis is noteworthy, as coffee does not increase the risk of hypertension, possibly owing to its other antihypertensive effects (diuresis, RAAS inhibition, and antioxidant properties). Cornelis et al reported that the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction depended on the ability of an individual to metabolize caffeine.27 CYP1A2 accounts for approximately 95% of caffeine metabolism, and great variability in enzyme activity is observed in individuals. The carriers of the variant allele CYPA12*1F are slow caffeine metabolizers, while those who are homozygous with the CYP1A2*1A allele are rapid metabolizers.27 This genetic difference could potentially explain the variable results noted across studies. The Cornelis et al study indicated a positive correlation between increased coffee consumption and the risk of nonfatal myocardial infarction but only in those who were slow metabolizers of caffeine.27 However, when smoking was involved, the results were once again conflicting because smoking induces CYP1A2 activity, and the magnitude of CYP1A2 induction was less pronounced in those who had the variant allele CYPA12*IF. The risk of myocardial infarction was higher in those who were slow caffeine metabolizers regardless of smoking status. While smoking may appear to decrease the risk of myocardial infarction by induction of the homozygous allele, smokers with the CYP1A2*1A allele do not necessarily bode better than slow metabolizers because smoking is an established independent cardiovascular disease risk factor with other pathologic mechanisms beyond the protective effects of CYP1A2 on caffeine regulation.27\nThe genetic associations identified by Cornelis et al27 were not observed in the large prospective analysis by Zhou and Hypp\u00f6nen (2019).24\nResults from these studies conflict, and the study designs include many possible confounders. The standardization of coffee preparation and intake is an important issue because the definition of light, moderate, and heavy consumption is not consistent across studies. As such, more studies are needed to reach a solid consensus about the impact of coffee consumption on cardiovascular disease, specifically at higher intake levels.\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE POST MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION\nIn a study by Silletta et al (2007), no association was found between moderate coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease events in patients who had had a myocardial infarction.28 After a mean follow-up of 3.5 years, coffee consumption did not change the risk of developing coronary heart disease, stroke, or sudden cardiac death in those who had previous myocardial infarction. These results are not substantially reliable because the trend finding across categories of coffee consumption was not statistically significant (P=0.18).28 A meta-analysis by Brown et al (2016) found a statistically significant inverse correlation between coffee consumption and mortality (n=3,271).29 Light coffee drinkers (1 to 2 cups per day) vs those who did not drink coffee were associated with a risk ratio of 0.79 (95% CI 0.66 to 0.94, P=0.008), while heavy coffee drinkers (>2 cups per day) vs those who did not drink coffee were associated with a risk ratio of 0.54 (95% CI 0.45 to 0.65, P<0.00001). Heavy coffee drinkers vs light coffee drinkers had a risk ratio of 0.69 (95% CI 0.58 to 0.83, P<0.0001).29 These results were supported by a 2020 meta-analysis of 6 prospective studies showing that coffee consumption was associated with lower risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.70, 95% CI 0.54 to 0.91, I2=0%; 2 studies) and not associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR 0.85, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.13, I2=50%; 3 studies), recurrent myocardial infarction (HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.22, I2=0%; 3 studies), or stroke (HR=0.97, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.49, I2=39%; 2 studies).30\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND HEART FAILURE\nData on diet and food intake from the Framingham Heart Study (FHS), the Cardiovascular Health Study (CHS), and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study were studied to identify potential lifestyle and behavioral factors associated with heart failure. Stevens et al (2021) showed an inverse association between coffee consumption and the risk of heart failure in all 3 studies.31 Data from the FHS, CHS, and ARIC showed that higher coffee consumption was associated with a lower long-term risk of heart failure.31 Mostofsky et al (2012) also observed a statistically significant J-shaped relationship between coffee consumption and heart failure; those who consumed up to 4 servings of coffee per day had a strong inverse relationship with the development of heart failure.32 Those who tended to consume coffee at much higher levels (starting at 9 to 10 servings per day) had a potentially higher risk of heart failure.32 Mostofsky et al found no evidence that sex, baseline history of myocardial infarction, or diabetes mellitus affected outcomes.32 From the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults study (n=2,735) published by the European Society of Cardiology (2020), low to moderate coffee consumption from young adulthood to middle age was associated with better left ventricular systolic and diastolic function.33\nAlthough results seem to be consistent across studies, the potential mechanisms causing reduction in heart failure risk are not well understood. A close look into the biomolecular processes is warranted to strengthen causality.\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\nBodar et al (2019) found that consumption of 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day was associated with lower rates of atrial fibrillation.34 After adjusting for age, smoking status, alcohol intake, and exercise, those who consumed \u22641 cup per week, 2 to 4 cups per week, and 5 to 6 cups per week were analyzed. In these subgroups, HRs were 0.85 (95% CI 0.71 to 1.02), 1.07 (95% CI 0.88 to 1.30), and 0.93 (95% CI 0.74 to 1.17), respectively. Among those who consumed 1 cup per day, 2 to 3 cups per day, and >4 cups per day, corresponding HRs were 0.85 (95% CI 0.74 to 0.98), 0.86 (95% CI 0.76 to 0.97), and 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.14), respectively, after adjusting for age, smoking, alcohol intake, and exercise (P for nonlinear trend=0.01). These results indicate that those who drank 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day had less risk of atrial fibrillation compared to other intake frequencies.34 A meta-analysis of prospective cohorts by Cheng et al (2014) showed an 11% reduction in atrial fibrillation risk for low coffee consumption equivalent to <500 mg of caffeine per day (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.99, P=0.032, I2=30.9%, P=0.227) and 16% for high coffee consumption equivalent to \u2265500 mg of caffeine per day (RR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.94, P=0.002, I2=24.1%, P=0.267) after pooling of results from studies with adjustment of potential confounders.35 A theory proposed to explain these results is that coffee promotes anti-inflammatory processes through its high levels of antioxidants such as cafestol, polyphenol, trigonelline, chlorogenic acid, and quinine.34,36 A meta-analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials by Ali-Hassan-Sayegh et al (2014) reported that antioxidants such as N-acetylcysteine and polyunsaturated fatty acids have a protective role in the prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.37 Patients who were infused with these antioxidant compounds experienced less incidence of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery.37 These results may suggest that coffee consumption, especially in moderation, may induce anti-inflammatory effects that may attenuate the risk of developing atrial fibrillation.\nCOFFEE CONSUMPTION AND MORTALITY\nA large pool of data indicates that coffee consumption is not associated with increased cardiovascular disease mortality. Results presented by Ding et al (2015) from 3 well-known large prospective cohort studies, the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, and the Nurses\u2019 Health Study-II, showed a nonlinear association between cardiovascular disease mortality and coffee consumption.38 In the analysis of the aforementioned cohort studies, moderate coffee consumption was associated with less mortality, and higher levels of consumption did not result in increased deaths after removing the confounding effects of smoking history. As such, the nonlinear relationship was strengthened by removing the residual confounding effect of smoking status. The authors concluded from their analysis that the results extracted from these 3 large cohort studies indicate that coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy lifestyle.38\nThe cohort study of Lopez-Garcia et al (2008) revealed an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality, principally because of a moderate reduction in risk for cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality in both males (P for trend=0.008) and females (P for trend <0.001).39 The authors noted that a possible mechanism for such an outcome was the strong antioxidant capacity of coffee compounds other than caffeine such as chlorogenic acid, ferulic acid, and p-Coumaric acid. They also noted that other substances in coffee such as magnesium, trigonelline, and quinides improve insulin sensitivity. Despite the potential harmful effects of caffeine and its ability to release epinephrine (a strong inhibitor of insulin), the aforementioned compounds appear to counterbalance this effect.39 In a large prospective cohort study conducted by de Koning Gans et al (2010), the consumption of black tea and coffee was associated with a lower incidence of coronary heart disease mortality.40 Andersen et al (2006) reported that consumption of 1 to 3 cups of coffee per day was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.91, P=0.005) in females compared to consumption of >4 cups per day.41 An earlier study by Kleemola et al (2000) noted a decrease in total mortality among females drinking >7 cups of coffee per day (risk ratio 0.62, 95% CI 0.44 to 0.87), even after adjusting for age, smoking status, serum cholesterol level, blood pressure, and history of myocardial infarction.42 Lopez-Garcia et al (2008) found a reduction in RR for all-cause mortality among females: RR of 0.93 (95% CI 0.87 to 0.98) for those drinking 5 to 7 cups per week; RR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.77 to 0.87) for those drinking 2 to 3 cups per day; RR of 0.74 (95% CI 0.68 to 0.81) for those drinking 4 to 5 cups per day; and RR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.73 to 0.95) for those drinking \u22656 cups per day (P for trend <0.001).39 In fact, most studies show an overall reduction in mortality, although some studies have produced conflicting results. The FHS showed that coffee consumption in the elderly population was associated with a 43% reduction in coronary heart disease\u2013related deaths.31 Furthermore, a large meta-analysis (40 studies, n=3,852,651) by Kim et al (2019) revealed that coffee consumption was inversely related to all-cause mortality.43 The total number of deaths from all categories was 450,256; among coffee consumers, the intakes with the lowest RRs were 3.5 cups per day for all-cause mortality (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.82 to 0.89), 2.5 cups per day for cardiovascular disease mortality (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.80 to 0.87), and 2 cups per day for cancer mortality (RR 0.96, 95% CI, 0.94 to 0.99). The inverse relationship between mortality and coffee consumption in nonsmokers (RR 0.95, 95% CI 0.93 to 0.97) was slightly stronger than in smokers (RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.96 to 0.99), although the difference was not statistically significant (P=0.33). No additional benefit was seen with additional caffeine intake. In conclusion, moderate coffee consumption was deemed beneficial to overall health. However, the associations were stronger in Europeans and Asians compared to Americans living in the United States.43 Studies are needed to understand these demographic differences.\nDISCUSSION\nCoffee has the physiologic effect of raising blood pressure, although the effect appears to be transient and does not affect the propensity to develop overt hypertension. Likewise, data have shown that moderate consumption of coffee is associated with less risk of hypertension but principally in those who never smoked or do not smoke and in those who are fast metabolizers of caffeine. Boiled coffee is atherogenic because of its rich diterpene content, namely cafestol and kahweol, that inhibits bile acid synthesis and ultimately affects lipid metabolism. On the other hand, filtered coffee, which is essentially devoid of the aforementioned compounds, exerts antiatherogenic properties by increasing high density lipoprotein\u2013mediated cholesterol efflux from macrophages through the influence of plasma phenolic acid. As such, cholesterol levels are influenced by the manner of coffee preparation (boiled vs filtered). In terms of the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, studies are inconsistent with regard to coffee consumption and risk of coronary heart disease, with discrepancies noted depending on sex, genetics, and smoking status. The majority of studies showed a J-shape association in which moderate coffee consumption was associated with a lower risk of coronary heart disease compared to heavy coffee consumption which was associated with an increased risk of coronary heart disease. These findings point to the importance of moderate coffee consumption because of the potential risk of cardiovascular disease. Regarding heart failure, results appear to be consistent across studies. The FHS, CHS, and ARIC studies showed that high coffee intake was associated with a decrease in long-term risk of heart failure independent of sex, baseline history of myocardial infarction, and diabetes. Because of the lack of understanding of potential mechanisms behind reduction in heart failure risk, more studies are needed. Moderate coffee consumption was also found to attenuate the risk of atrial fibrillation, possibly owing to its strong anti-inflammatory components such as cafestol, polyphenol, trigonelline, chlorogenic acid, and quinide. Studies have shown moderate coffee consumption to be associated with a reduction in all-cause and cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality, whereas higher amounts of coffee consumption were detrimental to health.\nCONCLUSION\nOur review suggests that moderate coffee consumption is associated with a decrease in all-cause and cardiovascular disease\u2013related mortality, hypertension, cholesterol, heart failure, and atrial fibrillation, while consensus is lacking regarding the association between coffee consumption and the risk of developing cardiovascular disease. Despite previous concerns about coffee consumption being a significant coronary heart disease risk factor, most modern prospective cohort meta-analyses found no association between coffee consumption and coronary heart disease. However, results are inconsistent across studies. Most favorable outcomes are associated with moderate coffee consumption; however, there is no current consensus on the definition of moderate coffee consumption. Further, genetics possibly play a large role in determining hypertension and cardiovascular disease outcomes. This review illustrates that coffee is a complex mixture of compounds that may cause both harm and benefit.

      "content": "Where would society be without coffee? This beloved beverage sharpens focus, improves mood, and helps people be more productive. It's easy to see why it plays such an important role in everything from the modern workplace to the alternative music scene.\nHumans have long depended on coffee for a caffeinated boost. While it\u2019s unclear exactly when coffee was first consumed, historic evidence shows that it was prized as early as the 15th century. Most historians agree that coffee originated in the Islamic world, where it was closely tied to several important religious practices. With Ramadan, for example, it helped people abide by fasts during the day and stay awake at night.\nToday, coffee is one of the most popular beverages in the world. It is primarily grown in a region of the globe known as the \"bean belt,\" which includes most of Central and South America, as well as sections of Ethiopia and Indonesia.\nHealth Benefits\nCoffee is an excellent source of several antioxidants, including hydrocinnamic acids and polyphenols. These compounds may play a role in preventing several chronic and acute conditions.\nThe following are some of the most notable health benefits of drinking coffee:\nCoffee may play a role in reducing the risk of several types of cancer. Studies find that people who drink coffee regularly are less likely to develop prostate cancer. Additionally, the caffeine in coffee may help prevent everything from nonmelanoma skin cancer to endometrial cancer.\nSome studies indicate that regularly drinking caffeinated or decaffeinated coffee may reduce the risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. As a bonus, the caffeine in coffee does not have a notable impact on blood sugar.\nPrevent Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease\nCoffee consumption is linked to a decreased risk of developing conditions such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. For people currently diagnosed with Parkinson's, drinking coffee may help reduce the frequency of tremors.\nNutrition\nNutrients per Serving\nA single cup of brewed coffee contains:\n- Calories: 2\n- Protein: Less than 1 gram\n- Fat: 0\n- Carbohydrates: 0 grams\n- Fiber: 0 grams\n- Sugar: 0 grams\nThings to Watch Out For\nCoffee may be low in calories when enjoyed black, but adding cream and sugar can quickly make it less healthy. If you dislike the bitter taste of black coffee, try it with a small amount of low-fat milk or a milk alternative, such as almond milk.\nBe sure to drink plenty of water when consuming coffee, as the beverage acts as a diuretic and can increase the risk of dehydration. Limit your coffee intake if you are pregnant or have high blood pressure.\nHow to Prepare Coffee\nCoffee can be purchased directly from roasters, at specialty shops, or at the grocery store. A variety of factors influence what type of coffee you should select. Many enthusiasts prefer beans from specific regions or specific roasters. Some people prefer the convenience of buying ground beans while others buy whole beans and grind them at home to ensure freshness.\nThe brewing method also matters. While many people use coffee machines, coffee can also be prepared in a percolator, with a French press, through cold-brewing, and via many other methods. Effort-intensive methods that emphasize freshness tend to deliver the best flavor, although quality beans can still produce a great pot via an ordinary drip coffee maker.\nCoffee may be enjoyed as either a hot or iced beverage, but there are also plenty of options for incorporating it in your cooking or baking. Give these ideas a try:\n- Blend iced coffee with frozen banana, yogurt, and chocolate protein powder to create a mocha smoothie.\n- Add brewed coffee to french onion soup to increase its savory flavor.\n- Prepare oatmeal using brewed coffee and milk and throw in additional toppings, such as chia seeds or maple syrup.\n- Use coffee and garlic to simmer a pot roast in the slow cooker.\n- Combine coffee with red wine and capers to add enticing flavors to beef stew.\n- Infuse coffee in your favorite rice pudding to make a mocha-flavored version.\n- Mix cooled coffee with balsamic vinegar, dijon mustard, and garlic to create a unique dressing for salads.",

      "content": "Moderate coffee drinking \u2014 about three to five cups a day \u2014 has been previously linked to reduced risks for dying early. A new study suggests that when people drink coffee could factor into these observed benefits. The researchers found that adults who drank coffee before noon saw the greatest reductions in dying early from any cause and from cardiovascular disease.\nFor this analysis, the investigators assessed nutrition data collected from more than 40,000 U.S. adults who participated in a long-term nutrition study. About half of participants, 52%, drank coffee. More than one-third, 36%, drank coffee in the morning. The rest, 16%, drank coffee throughout the day. After controlling for a variety of factors, the researchers found that adults who limited their coffee consumption to between 4 a.m. and noon were 16% less likely to die from any cause throughout nearly 10 years compared to adults who didn\u2019t drink coffee. They were also 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. These associations didn\u2019t extend to people who drank coffee throughout the day.\nThe researchers believe the benefits of drinking coffee in the morning may be due to two factors. First, drinking coffee with caffeine early in the day as opposed to in the afternoon or evening is less likely to alter a person\u2019s sleep patterns, which supports their overall and cardiovascular health. Second, the anti-inflammatory effects of coffee, whether it\u2019s caffeinated or not, may be strongest in the morning since this is when levels of inflammation can peak. The authors note more research is needed to study these and other associations linked to coffee\u2019s health benefits.\nThe findings from this study published in the European Society of Cardiology. The research was supported by NHLBI and the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",

A few daily cups of coffee may also lower your risk of type 2 diabetes and depression, support weight management, and help you live a longer life. Just keep in mind that experts recommend limiting caffeine if you\u2019re pregnant or nursing.\nCoffee is a beloved beverage known for its ability to fine-tune your focus and boost your energy levels.\nIn fact, many people depend on their daily cup of joe right when they wake up to get their day started on the right foot.\nIn addition to its energizing effects, coffee has been linked to a long list of potential health benefits, giving you all the more reason to get brewing.\nThis article takes an in-depth look at 9 of the top evidence-based benefits of coffee.\nCoffee contains caffeine, a central nervous system stimulant that\nThis is because caffeine blocks the receptors of a neurotransmitter called adenosine, which increases the levels of other neurotransmitters in your brain that regulate your energy levels, including dopamine.\nSome research suggests that consuming coffee regularly could be associated with a decreased risk of developing type 2 diabetes over the long term.\nIn fact,\nThis is thought to be due to coffee\u2019s ability to\nAlthough studies have shown mixed results, some research suggests that coffee may help protect against certain neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer\u2019s disease and Parkinson\u2019s disease.\nAccording to one review of 13 studies, people who regularly consumed caffeine had a significantly lower chance of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease. What\u2019s more, those who consumed caffeine also had a slower progression of Parkinson\u2019s disease over time.\nAdditionally, several studies have demonstrated that moderate coffee consumption could be associated with a\nAccording to\nFor example, one review of 12 studies concluded that higher coffee consumption could be associated with decreased body fat, especially in men.\nIn another\nFurthermore, one study found that people who drank one to two cups of coffee daily were\nSome studies have found that drinking coffee could be associated with a lower risk of depression.\nOne study in over 14,000 students found that drinking at least 4 cups of coffee each day was associated with a lower risk of depression, compared with drinking just 1 cup per day.\nCoffee could support liver health and protect against liver disease.\nA\nSome research shows that drinking coffee may benefit heart health.\nIn fact, one review found that drinking 3 to 5 cups of coffee daily reduced the risk of heart disease by\nAnother review of 21 studies showed that drinking 3 to 4 cups of coffee daily was associated with a\nAlso,\nHowever, keep in mind that caffeine could affect blood pressure levels. People with unmanaged blood pressure may need to limit or moderate their caffeine intake.\nSome research suggests that coffee could help extend longevity, thanks to its many potential health benefits.\nFor example,\nSimilarly, another\nInterestingly,\nHowever, more research is needed to determine whether this could also apply to humans.\nCoffee is often used as an ergogenic aid by athletes looking to improve performanceand increase energy levels.\nAn ergogenic aid is also called a performance enhancer.\nA\nAdditionally, a\nCoffee is a popular beverage that researchers have studied extensively for its many health benefits, including its ability to increase energy levels, promote weight management, enhance athletic performance, and protect against chronic disease.\nKeep in mind that some people may need to limit their intake, including people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, children and adolescents, and people with certain health conditions.\nStill, drinking coffee in moderation \u2014 about 3 to 4 cups per day \u2014 has been associated with several health benefits and is generally considered safe for most adults.\nJust one thing\nTry this today: Switching up your sweetener is one way to maximize the benefits of your daily cup of joe.\nInstead of using sugar or flavored syrups, opt for a naturally derived low calorie sweetener like stevia, or add a dash of cinnamon for flavor.",

A lot of recent research suggests that coffee offers a host of potential health benefits.\nEvery day, Americans drink 400 million cups of this incredibly complex beverage, which contains more than 1,000 compounds that can affect the body. The most commonly studied are caffeine (a nervous-system stimulant that's known to have positive cognitive effects) and polyphenols (antioxidants that can help slow or prevent cell damage).\nWhat health benefits does coffee offer?\nThough researchers don't always know exactly which of coffee's ingredients are responsible for producing their studies' health-boosting results, there's evidence that drinking coffee may help do the following:\n1. Improve overall health.\nAn analysis of nearly 220 studies on coffee, published in the BMJ in 2017, found that coffee drinkers may enjoy more overall health benefits than people who don't drink coffee.\nThe analysis found that during the study period, coffee drinkers were 17% less likely to die early from any cause, 19% less likely to die of heart disease and 18% less likely to develop cancer than those who don't drink coffee.\n2. Protect against Type 2 diabetes.\nA 2014 study by Harvard researchers published in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16 to 20 years.\nThose who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17% higher risk of developing the disease.\nThe reason may be the antioxidants in coffee, which reduce inflammation (inflammation contributes to your Type 2 diabetes risk).\nIf you already have Type 2 diabetes, however, you should avoid caffeinated products, including coffee. Caffeine has been shown to raise both blood sugar and insulin levels in people with the disease.\n3. Control Parkinson's disease symptoms.\nA number of studies have suggested that consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease \u2014 and research published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.)\n4. Slow the progress of dementia.\nIn a 2012 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.\nWhen the researchers re-evaluated the subjects two to four years later, those whose blood levels contained caffeine amounts equivalent to about three cups of coffee were far less likely to have progressed to full-blown dementia than those who had consumed little or no caffeine.\n5. Safeguard the liver.\nSeveral studies published in respected journals have found that coffee drinking has beneficial effects on the liver, including reducing the risk of death from liver cirrhosis, decreasing harmful liver enzyme levels and limiting liver scarring in people who have hepatitis C.\n6. Promote heart health.\nAccording to a study published in 2021 in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure, drinking one or more daily cups of plain, caffeinated coffee was associated with a significant reduction in a person's long-term risk of heart failure.\nThe study looked at the original data from three well-known heart disease studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study.\nAlthough there's not enough evidence to support prescribing coffee to lower your risk of heart disease risk, this recent revelation seems to strengthen previous findings that coffee is, in fact, good for heart health.\nIn 2013, the journal Epidemiology and Prevention published a review of studies analyzing the correlation between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. Data from 36 different studies showed that people who drink three to five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of heart disease than those who drink no coffee or more than five cups per day.\nWhile the reason isn't clear, one possibility is that coffee helps to improve blood vessels' control over blood flow and blood pressure.\n7. Reduce melanoma risk.\nA 2015 study appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the coffee-drinking habits of more than 447,000 people over 10 years. The researchers found that those who drank four or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day had a 20% lower risk of developing melanoma than people who drank decaffeinated coffee or no coffee.\n8. Lower mortality risk\nYour morning coffee could help lower your risk of death. A 2022 study in The Annals of Internal Medicine has shown that moderate consumption of unsweetened and sugar-sweetened coffee was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. The research shows that those who drank 1.5 to 3.5 cups of coffee per day, including with sugar, had a 30% less lower risk of death from any cause during the study.\nAdvice for coffee drinkers\nWe asked Steven K. Rothschild, MD, a family medicine physician at Rush University Medical Center and a dedicated two- to-three-cup-a-day man (black, no sweetener) to weigh in.\nWhile he's never gone so far as to prescribe a daily dose of java for any of his patients, he says, \"I'm certainly familiar with a lot of research showing that coffee has a mildly beneficial effect in protecting against issues like stroke, diabetes and cardiovascular problems.\"\nHe offers a few caveats, however:\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors.\nDon't doctor up your drink.\n\"Keep in mind that the research focuses on the benefits of black coffee, which we're still learning about,\" Rothschild says. \"But we definitely know the harms associated with the fat and sugar you find in a lot of coffee drinks.\"\nA Starbucks Venti White Chocolate Mocha, for instance, has 580 calories, 22 grams of fat (15 of which are saturated) and 75 grams of sugar. A plain cup of brewed coffee? Two calories, no fat and zero carbs.\nIf you can't drink it black, stick with low-calorie, low-fat add-ins, such as skim milk or almond milk.\nCoffee is for grownups only.\n\"It's not true that coffee will stunt kids' growth, as parents used to be fond of saying,\" Rothschild says. But there are a few good reasons for kids not to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks (e.g., colas and energy drinks).\nOne study, published in 2014 in the journal Pediatrics, showed that even small amounts of caffeine, equivalent to one cup of coffee, increased children's blood pressure and \u2014 to compensate for the rise in blood pressure \u2014 slowed heart rates.\nBeyond that, Rothschild says, he'd be concerned about sleep disruption and behavioral issues that might result from ingesting a stimulant.\nSwitch to decaf if you have acid reflux ...\n\"Caffeine causes the gastroesophageal sphincter to relax, which allows acid to enter the esophagus,\" Rothschild explains.\n... or insomnia ...\n\"People who have trouble sleeping can get into a vicious cycle: They sleep badly, increase their caffeine intake the next day to compensate, then sleep badly again, and on and on,\" he says, suggesting that people with insomnia avoid all caffeine after noon.\n... or osteoporosis.\n\"There's some evidence showing that moderate to high coffee consumption \u2014 more than four cups per day \u2014 is linked with calcium loss and fractures,\" says Rothschild.\nBut if you do drink decaf, definitely limit your consumption. That study in Circulation: Heart Failure found that decaffeinated coffee was actually associated with an increased risk for heart failure.\nEnjoy coffee in moderation.\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, Rothschild says, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors. \"Unless you have a condition like reflux, it's fine to keep drinking a reasonable amount of coffee,\" he says.\nBut you can also try other healthy ways to get some of the benefits you might attribute to coffee.\n\"For instance, if you rely on coffee to fight after-lunch sluggishness every day, you might think about getting outside and going for a 10 to 20 minute walk,\" Rothschild suggests. \"It'll not only wake you up, but you'll also get a lot of benefits in terms of bone health and cardiovascular health.\"",

      "content": "Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren\u2019t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.\nPlant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including cafestol and kahweol\nOne 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nCoffee and Health\nCoffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50\u2013300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?\nCancer\nCoffee may affect how cancer develops, ranging from the initiation of a cancer cell to its death. For example, coffee may stimulate the production of bile acids and speed digestion through the colon, which can lower the amount of carcinogens to which colon tissue is exposed. Various polyphenols in coffee have been shown to prevent cancer cell growth in animal studies. Coffee has also been associated with decreased estrogen levels, a hormone linked to several types of cancer. [5] Caffeine itself may interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells. [6] Coffee also appears to lower inflammation, a risk factor for many cancers.\nThe 2018 uproar in California due to warning labels placed on coffee products stemmed from a chemical in the beverage called acrylamide, which is formed when the beans are roasted. Acrylamide is also found in some starchy foods that are processed with high heat like French fries, cookies, crackers, and potato chips. It was classified in the National Toxicology Program\u2019s 2014 Report on Carcinogens, as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\u201d based on studies in lab animals. However, there is not yet evidence of a health effect in humans from eating acrylamide in food. Regardless, in March 2018 a California judge ruled that all California coffee sellers must warn consumers about the \u201cpotential cancer risk\u201d from drinking coffee, because coffee-selling companies failed to show that acrylamide did not pose a significant health risk. California\u2019s law Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, fueled the ruling, which requires a warning label to be placed on any ingredient from a list of 900 confirmed or suspected carcinogens.\nHowever, many cancer experts disputed the ruling, stating that the metabolism of acrylamide differs considerably in animals and humans, and the high amount of acrylamide used in animal research is not comparable to the amount present in food. They cited the beneficial health effects of coffee, with improved antioxidant responses and reduced inflammation, both factors important in cancer prevention. Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee may reduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk for the cancers that were studied.\nIn June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation exempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review.\nType 2 Diabetes\nAlthough ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body.\nIn a meta-analysis of 45,335 people with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 20 years, an association was found with increasing cups of coffee and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Compared with no coffee, the decreased risk ranged from 8% with 1 cup a day to 33% for 6 cups a day. Caffeinated coffee showed a slightly greater benefit than decaffeinated coffee. [7]\nAnother meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed similar associations. When comparing the highest intake of coffee (up to 10 cups a day) with the lowest (<1 cup), there was a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in those drinking the highest amounts of coffee and caffeine and a 20% decreased risk when drinking decaffeinated coffee. Further analysis showed that the incidence of diabetes decreased by 12% for every 2 extra cups of coffee a day, and 14% for every 200 mg a day increase in caffeine intake (up to 700 mg a day). [8]\nHeart health\nCaffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system that can cause different reactions in people. In sensitive individuals, it can irritate the stomach, increase anxiety or a jittery feeling, and disrupt sleep. Although many people appreciate the temporary energy boost after drinking an extra cup of coffee, high amounts of caffeine can cause unwanted heart palpitations in some.\nUnfiltered coffee, such as French press and Turkish coffees, contains diterpenes, substances that can raise bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Espresso coffee contains moderate amounts of diterpenes. Filtered coffee (drip-brewed coffee) and instant coffee contain almost no diterpenes as the filtering and processing of these coffee types removes the diterpenes.\nDespite these factors, evidence suggests that drinking coffee regularly may lower the risk of heart disease and stroke:\nAmong 83,076 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, drinking 4 or more cups of coffee each day was associated with a 20% lower risk of stroke compared with non-drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee also showed an association, with 2 or more cups daily and a 11% lower stroke risk. The authors found no such association with other caffeinated drinks such as tea and soda. These coffee-specific results suggest that components in coffee other than caffeine may be protective. [9]\nA large cohort of 37,514 women concluded that moderate coffee drinking of 2-3 cups a day was associated with a 21% reduced risk of heart disease. [10]\nIn addition, a meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies of men and women looking at coffee consumption and death from chronic diseases found a link between moderate coffee consumption (3 cups per day) and a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease deaths compared with non-drinkers. [11]\nAnother meta-analysis of 36 studies including men and women reviewed coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular diseases (including heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and deaths from these conditions). It found that when compared with the lowest intakes of coffee (average 0 cups), a moderate coffee intake of 3-5 cups a day was linked with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Heavier coffee intake of 6 or more cups daily was neither associated with a higher nor a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. [12]\nDepression\nNaturally occurring polyphenols in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee can act as antioxidants to reduce damaging oxidative stress and inflammation of cells. It may have neurological benefits in some people and act as an antidepressant. [13] Caffeine may affect mental states such as increasing alertness and attention, reducing anxiety, and improving mood. [14] A moderate caffeine intake of less than 6 cups of coffee per day has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide. However in a few cases of sensitive individuals, higher amounts of caffeine may increase anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Suddenly stopping caffeine intake can cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, and low mood for a few days and may persist for up to a week. [15]\nA prospective cohort study following 263,923 participants from the National Institutes of Health and American Association of Retired Persons found that those who drank 4 or more cups of coffee a day were almost 10% less likely to become depressed than those who drank none. [15]\nIn a meta-analysis of observational studies including 330,677 participants, the authors found a 24% reduced risk of depression when comparing the highest (4.5 cups/day) to lowest (<1 cup) intakes of coffee. They found an 8% decreased risk of depression with each additional cup of coffee consumed. There was also a 28% reduced risk of depression comparing the highest to lowest intakes of caffeine, with the greatest benefit occurring with caffeine intakes between 68 and 509 mg a day (about 6 oz. to 2 cups of coffee). [16]\nA review looking at three large prospective cohorts of men and women in the U.S. found a decreasing risk of suicide with increasing coffee consumption. When compared with no-coffee drinkers, the pooled risk of suicide was 45% lower among those who drank 2-3 cups daily and 53% lower among those who drank 4 or more cups daily. There was no association between decaffeinated coffee and suicide risk, suggesting that caffeine was the key factor, rather than plant compounds in coffee. [17]\nNeurodegenerative diseases\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is mainly caused by low dopamine levels. There is consistent evidence from epidemiologic studies that higher consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk of developing PD. The caffeine in coffee has been found in animal and cell studies to protect cells in the brain that produce dopamine.\nA systematic review of 26 studies including cohort and case-control studies found a 25% lower risk of developing PD with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee. It also found a 24% decreased risk with every 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. [18]\nA Finnish cohort study tracked coffee consumption and PD development in 6,710 men and women over 22 years. In that time, after adjusting for known risks of PD, those who drank at least 10 cups of coffee a day had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease than non-drinkers. [19]\nA large cohort of men and women were followed for 10 and 16 years, respectively, to study caffeine and coffee intake on PD. The results showed an association in men drinking the most caffeine (6 or more cups of coffee daily) and a 58% lower risk of PD compared with men drinking no coffee. Women showed the lowest risk when drinking moderate intakes of 1-3 cups coffee daily. [20]\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease: In the CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) study, drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day at midlife (mean age 50 years) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease later in life compared with low coffee drinkers after 21 years of follow-up. [2]\nHowever, three systematic reviews were inconclusive about coffee\u2019s effect on Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to a limited number of studies and a high variation in study types that produced mixed findings. Overall the results suggested a trend towards a protective effect of caffeine against late-life dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but no definitive statements could be made. The authors stated the need for larger studies with longer follow-up periods. Randomized controlled trials studying a protective effect of coffee or caffeine on the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia are not yet available. [21-23]\nGallstones\nThere are various proposed actions of caffeine or components in coffee that may prevent the formation of gallstones. The most common type of gallstone is made of cholesterol. Coffee may prevent cholesterol from forming into crystals in the gallbladder. It may stimulate contractions in the gallbladder and increase the flow of bile so that cholesterol does not collect. [24]\nA study of 46,008 men tracked the development of gallstones and their coffee consumption for 10 years. After adjusting for other factors known to cause gallstones, the study concluded that men who consistently drank coffee were significantly less likely to develop gallstones compared to men who did not. [24] A similar large study found the same result in women. [25]\nMortality\nIn a large cohort of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, an association was found between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and lower risk of early death. Compared with non-drinkers, those who drank 3-5 cups of coffee daily were 15% less likely to die early from all causes, including cardiovascular disease, suicide, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee provided benefits. The authors suggested that bioactive compounds in coffee may be responsible for interfering with disease development by reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. [26]\nIn a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 people followed for 10 years, an association was found between drinking higher amounts of coffee and lower rates of death from all causes. Compared with non-drinkers, those drinking 6-7 cups daily had a 16% lower risk of early death. [26] A protective association was also found in those who drank 8 or more cups daily. The protective effect was present regardless of a genetic predisposition to either faster or slower caffeine metabolism. Instant and decaffeinated coffee showed a similar health benefit.\nThe bottom line: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\nWhat about iced coffee?\nTypes\nCoffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.\nType of bean.There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.\nType of roast.Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.\nType of grind. A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.\nDecaffeinated coffee. This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.\nWatch out for hidden calories in coffee drinks\nA plain \u201cblack\u201d cup of coffee is a very low calorie drink\u20148 ounces only contains 2 calories! However, adding sugar, cream, and milk can quickly bump up the calorie counts. A tablespoon of cream contains 52 calories, and a tablespoon of whole milk contains 9 calories. While 9 calories isn\u2019t a lot, milk is often poured into coffee without measuring, so you may be getting several servings of milk or cream in your coffee. A tablespoon of sugar contains 48 calories, so if you take your coffee with cream and sugar, you\u2019re adding over 100 extra calories to your daily cup.\nHowever, the real caloric danger occurs in specialty mochas, lattes, or blended ice coffee drinks. These drinks are often super-sized and can contain anywhere from 200-500 calories, as well as an extremely large amount of sugar. With these drinks, it\u2019s best to enjoy them as a treat or dessert, and stick with plain, minimally sweetened coffee on a regular basis\nStore\nPlace beans or ground coffee in an airtight opaque container at room temperature away from sunlight. Inside a cool dark cabinet would be ideal. Exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light can strip coffee of its flavor. Coffee packaging does not preserve the coffee well for extended periods, so transfer larger amounts of coffee to airtight containers.\nCoffee can be frozen if stored in a very airtight container. Exposure to even small amounts of air in the freezer can lead to freezer burn.\nMake\nFollow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water.\nFor optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time.\nUse ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks.\nDid You Know?\nIt is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration!\nCoffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a pleasant coffee flavor.\nWhile water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the coffee.\nRelated\nCaffeine\nCaffeine is naturally found in the fruit, leaves, and beans of coffee, cacao, and guarana plants. It is also added to beverages and supplements. Learn about sources of caffeine, and a review of the research on this stimulant and health.\nJe Y, Liu W, and Giovannucci E.
