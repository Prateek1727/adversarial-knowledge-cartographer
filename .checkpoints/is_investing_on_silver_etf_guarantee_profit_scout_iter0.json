      "content": "Listen to this article in summarized format\n\u201cIf silver allocation has become a larger share than intended in your portfolio, we believe some profit-booking is justified. Over a long horizon (5 years or more), staying invested remains constructive,\u201d Thomas Stephen, Director & Head - Preferred, Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited shared with ETMutualFunds.\nAlso Read | Quant Mutual Fund increases exposure in select private banks; remains constructive on NBFC and 7 other sectors\nSharing a similar opinion, Vishal Dhawan, Founder & CEO, Plan Ahead Wealth Advisors recommends that given these dynamics, investors should avoid reacting emotionally to short-term swings; If silver exposure has exceeded target allocations due to the run-up, partial profit-booking as part of disciplined rebalancing is healthy, not because the long-term story is broken, but because positions must align with long-term allocations.\nDhawan adds that if exposure remains within limits, continuing to hold is sensible, as structural deficits and medium-term macro tailwinds still support precious metals and the key is discipline, not FOMO in our view.\nThere are 21 silver based ETF and FoFs which have delivered an average return of 98.51% in the said time period. Out of these 21 funds, 10 gave over 100% return in 2025 so far. UTI Silver ETF offered the highest return of 100.89% in 2025 so far, followed by ICICI Pru Silver ETF which gave 100.72% return.\nHDFC Silver ETF and SBI Silver ETF delivered 100.29% and 100.04% respectively in 2025 so far. Nippon India Silver ETF gave 99.98% return in the said time period. Axis Silver FoF and Tata Silver ETF FoF gave 94.38% and 92.52% returns respectively in the same time period.\nStellar performance in 2025\nSilver ETFs have been around in the industry from calendar year 2022. ETMutualFunds checked the performance of these funds in the calendar year 2022, 2023, and 2024. The highest return offered by a silver ETF in all these three calendar years was 36.12% in 2022 and max a fund lost was 7.19% in 2024.Factors contributing to stellar performance in 2025\nAccording to Thomas Stephen, with global economic uncertainty, unlike gold, silver combines safe-haven appeal with strong industrial demand (for electronics, EVs, solar panels, etc.) and along with this, solid central banks buying around the world coupled with festive demand led to further surge in prices.In addition to this, Dhawan adds that Silver\u2019s strong YTD performance was driven by a mix of structural and cyclical forces and silver continues to straddle its dual identity as both a precious metal and industrial commodity, which means its price responds not just to monetary conditions but also to manufacturing cycles.\n\u201cEarlier this year, optimism around EVs, solar panels, the green transition, and global electrification drove expectations of sustained industrial demand. Global investors also poured money into silver ETFs amid expectations of rate cuts, softer real yields, and a weaker dollar, amplifying the rally. However, it is important to acknowledge that a significant part of the recent surge was driven by speculative flows supported by a gold rally, rather than purely fundamental buying,\u201d Dhawan further explained.\nSatish Dondapati, Fund Manager, Kotak Mutual Fund is of the opinion that Silver prices have reached an all-time high, driven largely by a persistent global supply deficit and industries like electronics, solar panels and automotive are using more silver, while investment demand has also increased, which tightens supply. On the supply side, several structural constraints are contributing to the shortage.\n\u201cMining has slowed due to lower ore quality, higher costs, and delays in new projects. Limited exploration of new reserves adds to the shortage. Silver is also seen as a safe-haven asset during economic uncertainty, protecting against inflation, currency fluctuations, and global market volatility. All these factors together have made silver scarcer, pushing prices to record levels and raising concerns about whether the market can meet both industrial and investment needs in the near future,\u201d the fund manager from Kotak Mutual Fund adds.\nAlso Read | Sectoral, thematic mutual funds lead returns chart in Nov with up to 11% gains. What\u2019s next for investors?\nLooking at the past performance should one enter in silver ETFs and FoFs now or is one buying at peak?\nAccording to Dhawan, silver remains one of the most volatile metals, with volatility more than twice that of gold, because industrial cycles dominate short-term price movements and investors must remember that the sharp rally earlier had a heavy speculative movement.Entering at elevated levels through a lump-sum risks getting locked in if volatility spikes again and that would not be an ideal choice, Dhawan recommends. \u201cTherefore, while silver may not be at an irrational peak, the prudent approach is to avoid lump-sum entries and consider the current levels as a phase for staggered accumulation via SIP/STP, which smoothens the volatility. Any meaningful correction can give a better entry point to go lumpsum in this space.\u201d\nThomas Stephen is of the opinion that if your investment horizon for silver is long term, entry in silver ETFs/FoFs should be done via SIP/STP.\nWhat allocation to have in silver ETFs or FoF and preferred mode of investment\nCommenting on the allocation one must have in this precious metal, Dhawan is of the view that precious metals as a category should typically form 5\u201310% of an investor\u2019s total portfolio, balancing diversification, liquidity, and inflation protection and within this, a 70%:30% allocation between gold and silver is generally appropriate, with gold anchoring stability and silver adding cyclicality and industrial growth potential. \u201cThis translates to 1\u20133% of total portfolio exposure to silver for most investors, and up to 4\u20135% for those with higher conviction or risk appetite in a potential multi-metal cycle driven by de-dollarization, green energy, and cautious monetary policy,\u201d he added.\nHaving a similar view, Thomas Stephen recommends having nearly 5%-10% of your portfolio allocation towards precious metals (gold plus silver); within precious metal allocation, the allocation towards gold and silver should be based on the risk profile and if one is conservative, the allocation towards gold should be more and vice-versa.\nIn October, most of the fund houses suspended the fresh subscription in their silver ETF FoFs citing that the prices of silver in India have risen significantly above global benchmarks due to local shortages, which has led to inflated prices of silver ETFs on the exchange. The premium of the silver price in India is mainly due to supply constraints.\nNote, all these fund houses have now resumed fresh subscription in their respective silver ETF FoFs.\nNow the important thing is will silver ETFs hit a fresh record high again? Thomas Stephen said that given structural demand from green energy (solar), EVs, electronics and potential continued global macro uncertainty \u2014 silver seems to have a case for medium-long term appreciation. \u201cFurther, much of silver supply comes as a by-product of other metal mining (copper, lead, zinc). So even if silver prices rise, new supply cannot quickly expand. This structural inelasticity supports higher price potential if demand stays strong. That said, volatility will remain high; periodic corrections are probable,\u201d he added.\nAlso Read | Top 10 mutual funds to invest in December 2025\nAccording to a release by Emkay Wealth Management, Silver continues to shine as an investment asset, with both Silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) and Silver Fund of Funds (FoFs) outperforming physical silver over the past three-year period.\nThe release further mentioned that Silver is expected to bounce back to the US$ 52-US$53 levels and thereafter may move towards the next targets of US$58 and US$ 62, with strong support at US$ 47.60.\nTo this Dhawan adds that, with GSR still elevated near 80:1, there is meaningful scope for realignment if monetary policy turns supportive or industrial sentiment revives and in the broader precious metals narrative fresh record highs over the next 12\u201324 months remain likely, although the path can be very volatile.\n\u201cUltimately, in a world dominated by intangibles and financial assets, precious metals continue to act as real-asset anchors where gold provides the confidence, and silver delivers the cyclical momentum,\u201d Dhawan added.\nThere are alternatives as well for diversification such as gold ETFs or multi asset allocation funds. Multi-asset allocation funds are hybrid funds that need to invest a minimum of 10% in at least 3 asset classes. These funds typically have a combination of equity, debt, and gold. Some schemes also add international equities, InvITs and REITs.\nThe equity allocation in the case of multi-asset funds could vary between 0-70%. Aggressive multi-asset funds could typically have 50-65% equity while the conservative ones could have between 35-50%. In the case of multi-asset funds, some schemes that allocate more than 65% to equity enjoy equity taxation.\nSo should investors consider investing in these alternatives as well? Dhawan believes that Gold remains the core metal in long-term allocation due to its monetary linkage, central bank buying, and stability across economic cycles whereas silver, on the other hand, offers higher torque, benefiting from both monetary easing and industrial recovery but with significantly higher volatility.\nIn a diversified portfolio, gold provides confidence while silver adds momentum, especially in a world where de-dollarization, geopolitical shifts, and energy transition are reshaping global metal cycles.\nAccording to the expert from Anand Rathi Share and Stock Brokers Limited, \u201cYes, it totally depends on an individual\u2019s objective and risk profile. Gold ETFs and multi-asset funds provide diversification, but it is advisable to get your portfolio reviewed by a professional who can recommend suitable products based on your risk profile and investment objective.\u201d\nOne should always invest based on their risk appetite, investment horizon, and goals.\n(Disclaimer: Recommendations, suggestions, views and opinions given by the experts are their own.

      "title": "Best Silver ETFs to Buy in 2026 | The Motley Fool",
      "content": "Silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are funds that invest in silver mining stocks or hold silver bars. They enable anyone to invest in the precious metal through a straightforward investment, positioning them to profit from the potential rise in the price of silver in the future.\nA big catalyst for silver demand is the energy transition to a low-carbon economy. Silver is an excellent conductor of electricity. It's a key material used in manufacturing electric vehicles and solar panels.\nLike other precious metals, silver also has investment properties. Investors use it to diversify their portfolios and provide protection against inflation, geopolitical risks, and financial market downturns.\nSilver ETFs allow investors to gain exposure to silver without owning the physical precious metal or trying to pick the best silver stock. Here's a closer look at the best silver-focused ETFs to consider.\nBest silver ETFs\nAbout a dozen ETFs focus on silver. Half of them concentrate on providing direct exposure to the price of silver. The rest have a strategic focus on investing in companies involved in the silver mining industry. Here's a snapshot of the best silver ETFs to consider buying:\nNYSEMKT: SLV\nKey Data Points\nThe iShares Silver Trust ETF provides investors with exposure to the price movement of silver. It has done a solid job tracking silver's price over the long term:\nThe iShares Silver Trust is a great investment vehicle for those who want direct exposure to physical silver without the costs, risks, and hassles of owning the metal. Physical silver helps investors with portfolio diversification and hedging against inflation.\nThis ETF provides those benefits at a relatively low cost, given its reasonable ETF expense ratio of 0.5%, which may be cheaper than the expense of insuring and storing physical silver coins and bars.\nAnother benefit of using an ETF to invest in silver is that they are very liquid investments. Investors can buy and sell an ETF like any stock (and with zero commission at most online brokerages). These factors make the iShares Silver Trust an ideal way to invest in silver to directly capture the potential rise in its price.\nGlobal X Silver Miners ETF\nThe Global X Silver Miners ETF provides investors with targeted exposure to silver mining stocks. It allows investors to participate in the potential upside of silver prices and production growth. Those features position the ETF to outperform the price of silver over the long term since the underlying mining companies can increase their profits faster than prices rise.\nNYSEMKT: SIL\nKey Data Points\nThe Global X Silver Miners ETF held shares of almost 40 silver mining stocks in late 2025. The ETF's top 10 holdings were:\n- Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM +3.74%): 22.1% of the fund's holdings\n- Pan American Silver (PAAS +4.48%): 12.9%\n- Coeur Mining (CDE +5.54%): 7.4%\n- Hecla Mining (HL +12.87%): 5.4%\n- Korea Zinc: 5.2%\n- Fresnillo (OTC:FNLPF): 5.2%\n- First Majestic Silver (AG +9.86%): 4.9%\n- Industrias Penol: 4.4%\n- OR Royalties (OR +3.71%): 4.1%\n- Buenaventura (BVN +2.07%): 3.6%\nThis ETF provides investors with exposure to a broad array of silver companies. Wheaton Precious Metals leads the way with more than a quarter of the fund's holdings. The company focuses on investing in precious metals streams. It provides funding to help companies develop silver, gold, and other mines. In exchange, it can buy a set portion of the mine's future production at a fixed price.\nWheaton Precious Metals' current streams entitle it to buy silver at $5.75 an ounce through 2029, enabling it to profit when silver is above that price. The streaming business model makes Wheaton Precious Metals less risky than most silver mining companies. Most of the rest of the ETF's holdings are global mining companies with meaningful silver production.\nThese companies provide investors with exposure to the upside of silver prices and their ability to grow profits faster as they increase production by developing and expanding mines while reducing costs. However, silver mining companies have some risks, including the potential for cost overruns, exposure to non-silver mines, debt, and other factors.\nGiven those factors, this metals ETF is best for investors seeking to potentially outperform silver prices over the long term. It provides broad exposure to about three dozen silver mining companies, making the ETF less risky than investing in a single silver miner that could underperform.\nAmplify Junior Silver Miners ETF\nThe Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF focuses on junior mining companies that explore for new resources and develop mines. These companies have significant upside potential since they discover new resources and develop mines. However, the potential rewards also carry more risks.\nThe ETF provides investors with broad exposure to smaller mining companies around the world. It owns shares of mining companies headquartered in the following countries:\n- Canada: 55.5%\n- U.S.: 31.6%\n- Peru: 4.1%\n- Sweden: 3.9%\n- Poland: 2.8%\n- Mexico: 1.6%\n- Australia: 0.5%\nAlthough the focus is on silver, many of these companies also mine other metals and basic materials. For example, First Majestic Silver is the purest silver producer in the industry, getting a peer-leading 57% of its revenue from silver and 90% from precious metals overall. Hecla Mining -- the largest silver producer in the U.S. and Canada and third-largest in the world -- is second-purest, at 44% of its revenue.\nMeanwhile, the key difference between the Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF and the Global X Silver Miners ETF is that the Amplify fund concentrates on smaller mining companies, whose small scale makes them riskier. Many early-stage exploration companies need outside capital to help develop their mines, increasing the risk of cost overruns or high debt burdens affecting their investment returns.\nGiven the risks, the Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF is best for investors seeking a higher return potential. Investors are paying a reasonable fee for this upside opportunity, considering the ETF's relatively modest expense ratio of 0.69%.\nAre silver ETFs right for you?\nSilver ETFs allow anyone to easily add some silver market exposure to their portfolio. Physical silver ETFs are low-cost and highly liquid, making them potentially better options than owning coins and bars.\nSimilarly, silver mining ETFs provide benefits over investing directly in a single silver mining company by spreading the risk over dozens of silver stocks. These factors make silver ETFs a great way to start investing in silver for people who want exposure to the metal's investment properties or upside potential.\nHowever, silver isn't for everyone. Investors need to firmly believe that its price will rise enough in the future to justify the risks of investing in the sector.\nHow to choose silver ETFs\nInvestors should evaluate several factors when choosing a silver ETF, including:\n- Investment focus: Some silver ETFs focus on holding the physical metal, while others invest in silver mining companies.\n- ETF Expense ratio: Investors need to consider whether an ETF's cost is in line with other funds.\n- Assets under management (AUM): Larger silver ETFs are less susceptible to potential manipulation.\nRelated investing topics\nHow to invest in silver ETFs\nAnyone can add a silver ETF to their portfolio. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to invest in them:\n- Open your brokerage app: Log in to your brokerage account where you handle your investments.\n- Search for the stock: Enter the ticker or company name into the search bar to bring up the stock's trading page.\n- Decide how many shares to buy: Consider your investment goals and how much of your portfolio you want to allocate to this stock.\n- Select order type: Choose between a market order to buy at the current price or a limit order to specify the maximum price you're willing to pay.\n- Submit your order: Confirm the details and submit your buy order.\n- Review your purchase: Check your portfolio to ensure your order was filled as expected and adjust your investment strategy accordingly.",

      "title": "How to Generate High Yields and Monthly Income from Silver ETFs",
      "content": "Gold prices may move lower next week. Here\u2019s why\nAs of December 29, just days before the New Year, silver prices are squeezing hard. Year to date, the metal is up more than 141%, an eye-popping move even by precious-metals standards.\nThere\u2019s no shortage of explanations floating around. Some point to tight physical supply, others to CME margin changes for futures, China\u2019s evolving export rules, or rising industrial demand tied to photovoltaics and electric vehicles. The honest answer is that it\u2019s likely a mix of all of the above, plus a healthy dose of animal spirits.\nWhat matters for investors is not why silver is moving, but how volatile it has become. That volatility cuts both ways. Taking a simple long-only position means signing up for sharp swings that can test even seasoned investors. But it also opens the door to something silver normally does not offer: income.\nYou don\u2019t need to take a strong directional view to participate. Options-based strategies can convert volatility into cash flow, effectively monetizing price swings rather than betting on them.\nThe trade-offs are real though. Some approaches cap upside, others introduce additional downside risk. But for income-focused investors, ETFs now make it possible to turn a traditionally non-yielding precious metal into a meaningful source of monthly cash flow.\nWith that in mind, here are two ways silver ETFs are currently being used to generate high yields and monthly income.\niShares Silver Trust (SLV)\nOur first option for generating income from silver relies on iShares Silver Trust (NYSE:SLV), the largest silver ETF by AUM at just over $30 billion. The fund tracks the LBMA silver price and holds roughly 527 million ounces of physical silver.\nLiquidity is excellent. SLV trades around 56 million shares per day on a 30-day average, with a very tight 30-day median bid\u2013ask spread of about 0.02%, making it well-suited for options strategies.\nSLV also has one of the deepest and most active options chains in the commodity ETF universe, with weekly expiries and a wide range of strike prices.\nAs of December 29, SLV is trading around $65 per share. Owning 100 shares requires about $65,000 in capital, which is the minimum needed to write covered calls.\nIf the goal is to generate monthly income, one approach would be to sell a slightly out-of-the-money call. Using the January 30, 2026 expiry as an example, selling the $70 strike generates roughly $3.20 per share in premium, or $320 per contract.\nAgainst a $65,000 position, that represents a monthly yield of about 0.49%. If you annualize that income, it works out to roughly a 6% annualized yield, assuming similar premiums could be earned each month.\nThe key benefit here is flexibility. By choosing the $70 strike, you retain upside from today\u2019s $65 price all the way up to $70, in addition to keeping the option premium.\nHowever, investors who are more income-focused can sell calls at the money. Selling the $65 strike instead generates a much higher premium, roughly $4.88 per share, or $488 per contract.\nThat translates to a monthly yield of about 0.75% on the same $65,000 position, or roughly 9% on an annualized basis. The trade-off is obvious. By selling at-the-money calls, you give up essentially all upside beyond the current price level in exchange for higher immediate income.\nThese examples highlight the core decision every covered-call investor has to make. More income means less upside. Less income preserves more participation if silver continues to surge.\nPremiums will also change from month to month as volatility and prices move, so these figures are not guaranteed. There is no free lunch here, only a set of trade-offs that need to be matched to your income goals and risk tolerance.\nKurv Silver Enhanced Income ETF (KSLV)\nIf you do not have $65,000 in idle capital to run covered calls on SLV, or you are simply not comfortable trading options yourself, there is a way to outsource the strategy through an ETF. That option is Kurv Silver Enhanced Income ETF (NYSE:KSLV), which is designed specifically to generate income from silver using options.\nKSLV is not a plain-vanilla covered call ETF. It does not mechanically sell the same at-the-money, 30-day SLV call each month. Instead, it is actively managed and can use a mix of SLV call and put options, including spreads and collars. The portfolio is backed primarily by Treasury bills, which serve as collateral.\nThis flexibility is both a strength and a risk. Unlike index-based covered call ETFs, KSLV is not systematic. That means it can potentially adapt to changing market conditions, but it also means outcomes depend heavily on manager skill. As a relatively new ETF, it does not yet have a long track record to judge how well that discretion translates into risk-adjusted results over a full market cycle.\nThe income profile is eye-catching. KSLV currently sports a distribution rate north of 21%. That level of yield comes with trade-offs. Investors should expect most capital appreciation in silver to be sacrificed in exchange for income. Moreover, a meaningful portion of distributions may be classified as return of capital that is not immediately taxable, but it reduces your adjusted cost base.\nFees are the main drawback. KSLV charges a 1.0% expense ratio, which is high even by active options ETF standards. While derivatives-based strategies do justify higher fees, this is still at the upper end of what income-focused investors should be willing to tolerate. A fee closer to 0.75% would make it more competitive with similar offerings from other options-focused ETF providers like NEOS.\nOverall, KSLV may be suitable for investors who want hands-off silver income and understand that the headline yield comes at the expense of upside, higher fees, and reliance on active management.\nDisclaimer: The information provided by ETF Portfolio Blueprint is for general informational purposes only.

Select silver ETFs like SLV or SIVR for instant liquidity, lower costs, and convenient trading. With silver reaching $39.28 in 2025\u2014a 14-year high\u2014your choice depends on investment timeline, storage capabilities, and risk tolerance.\nTable of Contents\n- Understanding Your Silver Investment Options\n- The Case for Tangible Silver Assets\n- Silver ETFs: Digital Convenience\n- True Cost Comparison Over Time\n- Storage and Security Considerations\n- Silver Market Dynamics in 2025\n- Tax Treatment Differences\n- Building Your Silver Portfolio\n- Which Investor Type Are You?\n- Performance During Market Stress\n- Making Your Investment Decision\n- Frequently Asked Questions\nUnderstanding Your Silver Investment Options\nSilver investing has surged to prominence in 2025, with spot prices hitting $39.28 per ounce\u2014a remarkable 35% gain year-to-date according to the Silver Institute. As investors seek portfolio diversification amid persistent inflation and geopolitical uncertainty, a critical decision emerges: should you own physical silver bars and coins, or opt for the convenience of silver exchange-traded funds (ETFs)?\nThis comprehensive guide examines both investment vehicles through the lens of current market conditions, helping you make an informed decision that aligns with your financial goals. Whether you're drawn to the tangible security of physical silver or the digital efficiency of ETFs, understanding the nuances of each option is crucial for maximizing your investment success.\n\ud83c\udfaf Key Factors Driving Silver Demand in 2025:\n- Industrial Consumption: Record 700+ million ounces annually for solar panels, EVs, and electronics\n- Supply Deficit: Fifth consecutive year of shortages totaling 474 million ounces since 2021\n- Central Bank Diversification: Russia's $535 million silver acquisition signals institutional interest\n- Inflation Hedge: Silver historically outperforms during high inflation periods\n- Green Energy Transition: Solar sector alone consuming 197.6 million ounces annually\nBefore diving into the specifics, it's essential to check the current silver spot price to understand market conditions. Silver's volatility creates both opportunities and risks, making your choice between physical and paper silver more consequential than ever.\nThe Case for Tangible Silver Assets\nPhysical silver represents the ultimate form of direct ownership\u2014you hold the actual metal in your hands or secure storage. This tangible asset offers unique advantages that paper investments simply cannot replicate, particularly during times of financial uncertainty.\nZero Counterparty Risk Advantage\nWith physical silver, your wealth exists independently of any financial institution's solvency, broker's operations, or fund manager's decisions. This elimination of counterparty risk proved invaluable during the 2008 financial crisis when numerous \"paper\" investments evaporated overnight.\n2025 American Silver Eagle\nThe 2025 American Silver Eagle remains the world's most recognized silver bullion coin. With enhanced security features and U.S. government backing, these coins offer unmatched liquidity and acceptance worldwide.\nInvestment Advantages:\n- \u2713 Legal tender status provides additional protection\n- \u2713 IRA-eligible for retirement accounts\n- \u2713 No reporting requirements for purchases\n- \u2713 Premium appreciation during supply crunches\nPhysical Silver Investment Options\nUnlike ETF holdings tracked electronically through brokerage accounts, physical silver transactions can maintain anonymity. Cash purchases under $10,000 require no reporting, and the metal can be stored privately without third-party knowledge. This feature appeals to those seeking wealth preservation outside traditional financial systems, especially given increasing government oversight of digital transactions.\n100 Ounce Silver Bars\nFor serious investors, 100-ounce silver bars offer the best value proposition. These industrial-grade bars minimize premiums while maximizing storage efficiency, making them ideal for larger allocations.\nWhy Choose 100 oz Bars:\n- \u2713 Lowest premium per ounce available\n- \u2713 Professional vault storage compatible\n- \u2713 Accepted by all major dealers\n- \u2713 Efficient wealth concentration\nSilver ETFs: Digital Convenience for Modern Portfolios\nSilver ETFs revolutionized precious metals investing by making silver as easy to trade as stocks.

You can buy or sell your entire position instantly during market hours, with tight bid-ask spreads typically around 0.05% for SLV. This flexibility proves invaluable for tactical traders or investors who might need quick access to capital.\n- Instant buying and selling during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM EST)\n- No dealer negotiations or shipping logistics\n- Transparent real-time pricing every second\n- Access through any brokerage account\n- Options trading available for hedging\nUnderstanding ETF Structural Risks\nETF investors face counterparty risks that physical silver owners avoid. Your investment depends on multiple parties: the ETF sponsor's operational integrity, the custodian bank's solvency (typically JPMorgan for SLV), sub-custodians' reliability, and authorized participants maintaining market liquidity. During the March 2020 crisis, several precious metals ETFs temporarily suspended new share creation, highlighting these structural vulnerabilities.\nHidden Costs of ETF Ownership\nWhile ETFs appear cheaper initially, several hidden costs impact long-term returns:\n- Management fees: 0.30-0.50% annually compounds over time\n- Tracking error: ETFs may underperform spot silver by 0.5-1% annually\n- Tax drag: Annual distributions create taxable events\n- Spread costs: Buying at ask, selling at bid reduces returns\n- No premium capture: Cannot benefit from physical premium spikes\nTrue Cost Comparison Over Time\nUnderstanding the total cost of ownership for both options requires looking beyond surface-level prices. Here's a comprehensive analysis based on a $50,000 investment held for various time periods:\nHistorical data reveals a crucial pattern: during severe market stress, physical silver premiums can spike dramatically while ETFs may face operational issues. In March 2020, physical silver premiums reached 50-100% above spot prices while ETFs traded at discounts to NAV. Investors holding physical silver could sell at these elevated premiums, while ETF holders faced potential redemption suspensions and couldn't access the physical metal.\n\ud83d\udca1 Pro Tip: Calculate Your Break-Even Timeline\nFor most investors, physical silver becomes more cost-effective than ETFs after 7-10 years when factoring in premium recovery at sale. If planning to hold for less than 5 years, ETFs typically offer better economics. Use this formula: Break-even years = Initial Premium \u00f7 (Annual ETF Fee - Physical Storage Cost)\nStorage and Security Considerations\nPhysical Silver Storage Challenges\nThe density and value of silver create unique storage challenges. A modest $50,000 silver position equals roughly 1,300 ounces or 90 pounds of metal\u2014equivalent to a large suitcase of coins or thirteen 100-ounce bars.\nSilver Buffalo Rounds\nFor budget-conscious investors, Silver Buffalo Rounds offer an excellent entry point. These privately minted rounds feature the classic buffalo design and provide silver exposure at lower premiums than government coins.\nSmart Choice For:\n- \u2713 New investors building positions\n- \u2713 Dollar-cost averaging strategies\n- \u2713 Bulk silver accumulation\n- \u2713 Barter/trade preparations\nSilver Market Dynamics in 2025\nThe silver market's unique characteristics\u2014part monetary metal, part industrial commodity\u2014create dynamics that affect physical and ETF investments differently.\nSupply and Demand Fundamentals\nHistoric Supply Deficit\nAccording to the Silver Institute's 2025 report, the market faces its fifth consecutive year of structural deficit, with demand exceeding supply by 117.6 million ounces. Industrial consumption hit a record 680.5 million ounces in 2024, driven by solar panel production (197.6 million ounces) and electric vehicle manufacturing.\n\ud83d\udfe2 Bullish Factors for Silver\n- Solar installations growing 25% annually through 2030\n- 5G infrastructure requiring 3x more silver than 4G\n- Electric vehicles using 2-3 oz per vehicle\n- Medical applications expanding (antimicrobial properties)\n- Central banks diversifying into silver (Russia, China)\n- Mining supply constrained by ore grade decline\n\ud83d\udd34 Headwinds to Consider\n- Economic recession reducing industrial demand\n- Thrifting and recycling improving (65% recovery rate)\n- Substitute materials in some applications\n- Strong dollar periods pressuring prices\n- Cryptocurrency competition for \"digital gold\" narrative\nHow Market Dynamics Affect Your Choice\nUnderstanding these dynamics helps position your portfolio appropriately. Physical silver shines during supply crunches and crises, while ETFs excel during calm markets with normal trading conditions.\nTax Treatment Differences\nThe IRS treatment of silver investments significantly impacts after-tax returns, making tax planning crucial for both options.\nImportant Tax Considerations\nBoth physical silver and silver ETFs face the 28% collectibles tax rate for long-term gains, significantly higher than the 15-20% rate for stocks. However, strategies exist to minimize tax impact:\n- Hold in self-directed IRAs for tax-deferred growth\n- Use losses to offset gains in other investments\n- Consider PSLV for potential 15-20% rate (structured as foreign trust)\n- Time sales strategically based on income levels\nFor detailed tax guidance specific to precious metals, consult the IRS Publication 544 or speak with a qualified tax professional familiar with collectibles taxation.\nBuilding Your Silver Portfolio Strategy\nRather than viewing physical silver and ETFs as mutually exclusive choices, sophisticated investors often combine both to optimize their portfolios.\nThe Hybrid Approach\nA well-designed silver investment strategy leverages the strengths of both physical and paper silver:\n- Core Holdings (60-70%): Physical silver stored securely for long-term wealth preservation\n- Trading Position (20-30%): ETFs for tactical allocation and rebalancing\n- Emergency Reserve (10%): Easily accessible physical silver for crisis scenarios\nAllocation by Investor Profile\nConservative Wealth Preserver\nFocus on American Silver Eagles and 100 oz bars for core holdings, with small ETF position for liquidity needs.\nBalanced Investor\nEqual allocation provides flexibility while maintaining tangible asset protection.\nActive Trader\nEmphasize ETFs for trading with modest physical position for portfolio insurance.\nFor broader precious metals diversification, consider how silver compares to gold investments and potentially allocate across both metals.\nWhich Investor Type Are You?\nYour personal circumstances, investment goals, and risk tolerance should drive your silver investment decision. Here's how different investor profiles typically approach the physical versus ETF choice:\nThe Wealth Preserver\nPrimary Goal: Protect purchasing power across generations\nTypical Allocation: 80% physical, 20% ETF\n- Values tangible assets outside financial system\n- Willing to pay for storage and insurance\n- Holds 10+ year time horizon\n- Focuses on Eagles and recognized coins\nThe Strategic Allocator\nPrimary Goal: Portfolio diversification and rebalancing\nTypical Allocation: 30% physical, 70% ETF\n- Wants silver exposure with flexibility\n- Rebalances quarterly or annually\n- Uses tax-advantaged accounts\n- Values liquidity and low costs\nThe Crisis Hedger\nPrimary Goal: Financial system insurance\nTypical Allocation: 100% physical\n- Prioritizes possession and control\n- Maintains multiple storage locations\n- Focuses on recognizable forms\n- Often holds gold too\nUnderstanding your investor profile helps clarify which option aligns with your objectives. Many investors evolve their approach over time, starting with ETFs for convenience and gradually adding physical holdings as their knowledge and wealth grow.\nPerformance During Market Stress\nHistory provides valuable lessons about how physical silver and ETFs perform during various crisis scenarios:\nCase Study: March 2020 COVID Crisis\nWeek 1-2: Initial Panic\n- Silver spot price crashed from $18 to $12\n- ETFs traded at 5-10% discounts to NAV\n- Physical dealers suspended sales\n- Premiums began expanding rapidly\nWeek 3-4: Supply Shortage\n- Physical premiums hit 50-100% over spot\n- Many dealers completely sold out\n- ETF creation halted temporarily\n- Delivery times extended to 8-12 weeks\nMonth 2-3: Recovery\n- Spot price recovered to $15-16\n- Physical premiums remained elevated at 30%+\n- ETFs resumed normal operations\n- Those holding physical captured premium gains\nKey Lesson\nDuring severe market dislocations, physical silver can trade at substantial premiums to spot prices, providing additional gains for holders. ETF investors remain locked to spot prices and may face operational disruptions. This premium expansion represents the market pricing in counterparty risk and delivery uncertainty.\nOther Historical Crisis Performance\nFor more insights on precious metals during uncertain times, explore our guide on how much silver you should own for proper crisis preparation.\nMaking Your Investment Decision\nAfter examining all aspects of physical silver versus ETFs, here's a practical framework for making your decision:\nAssess Your Investment Timeline\n- Less than 2 years: ETFs offer better liquidity and lower costs\n- 2-5 years: Consider a mixed approach\n- 5+ years: Physical silver's advantages compound over time\nEvaluate Your Risk Tolerance\n- Counterparty risk concern: Choose physical silver\n- Storage/security worry: ETFs eliminate these issues\n- Market volatility tolerance: Both options experience similar price swings\nConsider Practical Factors\n- Storage capability: Do you have secure storage options?\n- Investment size: Larger investments favor physical for premium efficiency\n- Geographic location: Some areas have better dealer networks\n- Tax situation: IRA eligibility may favor certain options\nDefine Your Goals\n- Crisis insurance: Physical silver only\n- Trading profits: ETFs provide better tools\n- Wealth preservation: Physical silver excels\n- Portfolio diversification: Either option works\nKey Takeaways for Silver Investors\n- Physical silver eliminates counterparty risk but requires secure storage\n- ETFs provide instant liquidity and low costs but introduce third-party dependencies\n- Tax treatment is similar (28% collectibles rate) for both options\n- Market dynamics can cause physical premiums to spike during crises\n- Many sophisticated investors use both for different purposes\n- Your timeline, storage capability, and risk tolerance should guide the decision\nFinal Perspective\nThe choice between physical silver and ETFs isn't necessarily either/or. Many successful investors recognize that each serves different purposes within a comprehensive investment strategy. Physical holdings provide insurance and wealth preservation, while ETF positions enable tactical trading and efficient rebalancing. By understanding each option's strengths and limitations, you can construct a silver investment approach tailored to your unique financial objectives.\nFrequently Asked Questions\nMost silver ETFs do not allow individual investors to redeem shares for physical silver. Only \"Authorized Participants\" (large financial institutions) can exchange ETF shares for physical metal, typically requiring minimums of 50,000+ shares. The exception is Sprott Physical Silver Trust (PSLV), which allows redemption for physical silver with a minimum of 10,000 shares (worth approximately $90,000). For smaller investors seeking physical silver, direct purchase remains the only option.\nDuring financial crises, silver ETFs face several potential disruptions: trading halts on exchanges, creation/redemption suspensions, significant premiums or discounts to NAV, liquidity provider withdrawal, and custodian bank issues. In March 2020, several precious metals ETFs temporarily suspended new share creation when physical silver became scarce. While ETFs have survived past crises, they remain dependent on functioning financial markets and counterparty solvency\u2014risks that physical silver avoids entirely.\nStorage costs vary significantly based on method and quantity. Home safe: $2,000-5,000 initial cost, no ongoing fees but requires insurance ($100-300/year per $50,000). Bank safe deposit box: $100-300 annually for a medium box holding 200-500 ounces. Professional vault storage: 0.5-1% of value annually including insurance. For example, storing $50,000 in silver professionally costs $250-500 yearly. Many investors find home storage most economical for amounts under $100,000.\n\"Safer\" depends on which risks concern you most. ETFs eliminate theft risk, storage hassles, and authentication worries\u2014making them safer from physical security standpoints. However, physical silver eliminates counterparty risk, custodian failure, market mechanics breakdown, and government/regulatory interference. Historical evidence suggests physical silver is safer during systemic crises while ETFs are safer during normal market conditions. Diversifying between both may provide optimal safety.\nSilver's lower per-ounce value makes manufacturing, shipping, and handling costs proportionally higher. A 1 oz silver coin requires similar production effort as a 1 oz gold coin but sells for 80x less, necessitating higher percentage premiums. Additionally, silver's industrial demand creates competition between investors and manufacturers, silver's bulkier nature increases storage/shipping costs, and VAT/taxes in some countries apply to silver but not gold. Premiums typically run 10-20% for silver versus 3-5% for gold.\nSilver ETF options offer leveraged exposure but come with significant risks: time decay (options expire worthless if silver doesn't move enough), volatility premiums during uncertain markets, complex tax treatment, and potential for 100% loss. Options work best for experienced traders hedging positions or making short-term directional bets. For long-term silver investment, owning shares or physical metal provides more predictable outcomes without expiration risk.\nETFs offer the lowest entry point\u2014you can buy a single share of SLV for about $24. Physical silver minimums depend on the product: 1 oz Silver Buffalo rounds start around $30-35, 1 oz American Silver Eagles cost $35-40, and 100 oz bars require $3,000+. However, shipping costs ($10-20 minimum) make small physical purchases inefficient. Most dealers offer free shipping above $199-299, making this a practical minimum for physical silver purchases.\nETFs provide superior liquidity during normal markets\u2014instant sales at tight spreads during market hours. Physical silver liquidity varies: major dealers typically buy back popular coins/bars at 2-5% below spot, local coin shops may pay less but offer immediate cash, private party sales can achieve better prices but take time, and during crisis periods, physical commands premiums while finding buyers becomes easier. Plan for 1-5 days to liquidate physical silver versus instant ETF sales.\nMajor silver ETFs like SLV and SIVR are physically backed, with silver stored in London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) approved vaults. However, the structure includes complexities: silver may be allocated or unallocated, sub-custodians may hold portions, some double-counting concerns exist in the system, and audit access remains limited. While reputable ETFs own physical silver, investors cannot verify their specific holdings and must trust the custodial chain.\nBoth metals serve crisis protection roles differently. Gold offers more value density (easier to store/transport large wealth), universal recognition across all cultures, and traditional safe-haven status. Silver provides smaller denominations for practical transactions, growing industrial demand supporting prices, and typically higher percentage gains in bull markets. Many experts recommend both: gold for wealth preservation and silver for practical utility plus higher volatility/return potential. A common allocation is 2:1 or 3:1 gold-to-silver ratio by value.\nReady to Start Your Silver Investment Journey?\nNow that you understand the crucial differences between physical silver and ETFs, take the next step toward building your precious metals portfolio. Whether you choose the tangible security of American Silver Eagles, the efficiency of 100-ounce bars, or the affordability of Silver Buffalo rounds, starting your silver investment begins with choosing a trusted dealer.\nQuestions?

      "content": "All You Need to Know about Silver ETFs\nLike gold, silver is another popular commodity for Indian investors. However, many people find purchasing and selling a large amount of physical silver too difficult. It becomes even more problematic if someone has to transport silver from one city to another. There is also an added difficulty in storage and safety. Investing in silver Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) can free you from all these hassle. If you plan to invest in silver ETFs, this blog is for you.\nWhat Is a Silver ETF?\nSimilarly, Silver ETFs are financial instruments whose underlying asset is silver. The market forces determine the prices of silver ETFs. Silver ETFs invest approximately 95% of their corpus in physical silver or assets like Exchange Traded Commodity Derivatives (ETCDs) in silver. Thus, silver ETFs track the spot price of silver and deliver returns based on the same.\nA fund manager of a silver ETF needs to purchase and store silver in vaults. They must also look after periodic audits concerning the physical verification of this silver. Another requirement is that silver ETFs can only invest up to 10% of the entire corpus in silver ETCDs.\nHow Do Silver ETFs Work?\nSilver ETFs track the prices of physical silver in the open market. Demand and supply of silver throughout the trading day influence their price. Any fluctuation will directly influence the NAV of silver ETFs. As market forces determine the price of silver, any fluctuation will directly influence the Net Asset Value (NAV) of silver ETFs.\nWhat Are the Benefits of Silver ETFs?\nThe points below highlight the important features of silver ETFs.\nHedging Against Inflation\nWhen the inflation is higher, commodities like gold and silver serve as a hedge for investors. Investors can buy silver and gold to safeguard their investments against losses during inflation. When the prices of stocks fall, gold and silver prices increase.\nOffers Portfolio Diversification\nInvestors can diversify their portfolios by investing in commodities like silver and volatile assets like stocks. It will balance their portfolio\u2019s risk, and returns as silver help mitigate overall risks and offer steady returns during inflationary periods.\nPurity of Asset\nWhen investing in metals like silver, purity is one of the important concerns to cross our minds.

These are stored in secure vaults and audited periodically.\nTherefore, you can rest assured that you are investing in a pure commodity while investing in silver ETFs.\nLiquidity\nTrading with silver ETFs offers more liquidity than trading with the commodity itself. Purchasing and selling physical silver is quite time-consuming compared to ETFs.\nNo Storage Cost\nSilver ETF eliminates the problem of buying, transporting and storing silver in its physical form. Therefore, as investors, you do not need to bear any costs to store them.\nHow Are Silver ETFs Different From Physical Silver?\nHere are a few differences between silver ETFs and physical silver.\nHow Are Silver ETFs Taxed?\nLike stocks and mutual funds, silver is also a capital asset. Therefore, gains from silver investments are subject to taxation depending on how long the investor holds the investment.\nIf the holding period is less than 3 years (36 months), the gains will be treated as short-term capital gains (STCG). In the case of STCG, the profits will be added to your income and taxed as per your income tax bracket.\nHowever, holding silver ETFs for more than 3 years will be termed as long-term capital gains (LTCG). As per the Income Tax Act of 1961, LTCG is subject to 20% tax with the benefit of indexation.\nWith recent change in budget 2023, all the gains will be classified as STCG and normal tax slab rare will be applicable.\nThings to Keep in Mind before Investing in Silver ETF\nHere are certain things you must consider before investing in Silver ETFs in India.\nTracking Error\nAs an investor, you should analyse the tracking error while trading with any ETF. Furthermore, you must choose to invest in those silver ETFs that have minimal tracking error.\nRisk Appetite\nBefore investing in silver ETFs, understand your financial standing and risk appetite. Silver ETFs are risky investments as their prices rise and fall according to demand and supply. Therefore, only invest in these ETFs if you are comfortable with risky investments.\nExpense Ratio\nBefore picking an ETF to invest in, it would be beneficial to check the expense ratio of several silver ETFs. It is also important to remember that the expense ratio and investment returns are inversely proportional. Therefore, a silver ETF with a high expense ratio will reduce your returns and vice versa.\nFinal Words\nSilver ETFs offer an easy and accessible way for anyone to take exposure to the ups and downs of the commodity\u2019s prices. Consider analysing your budget and risk appetite to know whether they fit your investment goals. You may also seek assistance from financial advisors to see whether you should invest in this asset and plan your finances accordingly.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\nWho should invest in a silver ETF?\nInvestors willing to diversify their portfolio can invest in silver ETFs.

[...] \"Physically backed silver ETFs offer three significant advantages over other types of silver investments: transparency, liquidity and convenience,\" says Sean August, CEO of the August Wealth Management Group. \"These ETFs regularly disclose the amount of silver held, are easily traded on major exchanges and grant exposure to silver prices without the need to store and insure bullion.\" [...] \"Silver mining stocks can offer indirect exposure to silver prices and tend to be leveraged plays on silver prices, owing to the fixed costs of extracting the metal,\" explains Roberta Caselli, commodities investment strategist at Global X ETFs. \"Unlike investing directly in silver, miners can expand production as profit margins grow, which can benefit their share prices.\" SIL charges a 0.65% expense ratio.\n\n## Amplify Junior Silver Miners ETF (SILJ)",

      "content": "On the surface, buying a bullion-backed exchanged-traded fund seems harmless. An ETF (or ETN, Exchange-Traded Note) is a security that tracks an index, sector, commodity, or other asset, but can be bought or sold just like a stock.\nGold ETFs are no different. They track the price of the metal, don\u2019t require you to store any bullion, and even list the serial numbers of the bars they hold on their website. Sounds good, right?\nBut similar to the old joke about \u201cwaterfront\u201d land in Florida that turns out to be swampland, these products are not as straightforward as they sound once you look closely. The reality is, bullion ETFs carry much greater risk than most investors realize. Further, a crisis of any serious nature may demand that you have not just price exposure, but actual metal in your possession.\n- Though ETF shares tend to track the price of gold or silver, owning ETF shares exposes you to many disadvantages vs. owning physical metal\n- The fine print in ETF prospectuses is riddled with loopholes and escape clauses that absolve the fund of responsibility in any number of situations that could prove disastrous to your holdings\n- The number one reason owning physical metal is vastly superior to owning shares in an ETF is zero counterparty risk: you own actual gold or silver instead of an unenforceable digital claim on gold or silver\nThis article examines the key structural defect inherent in all bullion ETFs, three specific risks you face with current ETF products, and the fundamental reason investors need a meaningful amount of physical gold and silver in their possession.\nThe One Sentence Every Bank Customer Fears\nImagine you log on to your bank account to withdraw some cash, and receive a notification that includes the following statement:\n- \u201cWe regret to inform investors that cash withdrawals are not permitted at this time.\u201d\nThe things is, this is not fiction\u2026 it\u2019s not some old reference to the Great Depression\u2026 and it didn\u2019t occur in a third world country. It happened in Great Britain, in 2011.\nWithin 11 days after Britain voted to leave the EU (aka, Brexit), M&G Investments, Aviva Investors, and Standard Life all temporarily banned clients from withdrawing funds due to \u201cextraordinary market conditions.\u201d\nThese are not small, obscure funds in the UK. Each manages billions of British pounds. Because of the unexpected outcome on Brexit, however, it quickly became apparent that continued redemptions would cause a liquidity crisis and force management to dump assets at fire-sale prices. Executives at each fund felt they had no choice.\nThe result was that regular depositors couldn\u2019t get their own money out.\nWhat does this have to do with bullion-backed funds? Gold ETFs have the same risks as those funds. And those risks all center around two words\u2026\nCounterparty Risk\nCounterparty risk is simple: it means you rely upon another party to make good on your investment. If they fail, for any reason, your investment is in jeopardy. Even a simple savings account relies on the bank to be in a position to honor paying out your savings at any time and in any amount.\nThe counterparty for the UK investors were the funds themselves. They were temporarily unable to return depositors\u2019 money when they needed it (and consider that since it was a crisis at the time, it was precisely when customers needed access to that cash the most).\nEvery bullion-backed ETF also has counterparty risk. When you buy a gold ETF, you rely upon many factors, probably more than you realize\u2026\n- Fund structure\n- Chain of custody\n- Management proficiency\n- Operational integrity\n- Delivery agreements\n- Regulatory oversight\nIf any of these break down, your investment could be at risk. Delays for redemptions could easily take place, just like with the UK funds above. More importantly, with the type of crises Mike Maloney sees ahead, it is highly likely that one or more of these counterparty risks will materialize with bullion ETFs. In fact, some already have, as you\u2019ll see.\nHere are three distinct counterparty risks of gold ETFs that every investor should be aware of\u2026\nRisk #1: Emergency Liability\nA lot has been written about the pitfalls of GLD (SPDR Gold Trust), the largest gold bullion fund in the market. But what many investors don\u2019t know is that it carries enormous counterparty risk.\nThe following statements are all buried deep within the most recent fund prospectus (May 8, 2017):\n- If the Trust\u2019s gold bars are lost, damaged, stolen or destroyed under circumstances rendering a party liable to the Trust, the responsible party may not have the financial resources sufficient to satisfy the Trust\u2019s claim.\n- If the Custodian becomes insolvent, its assets may not be adequate to satisfy a claim by the Trust or any Authorized Participant. In addition, in the event of the Custodian\u2019s insolvency, there may be a delay and costs incurred in identifying the gold bars held in the Trust\u2019s allocated gold account.\n- The gold bullion custody operations of the Custodian are not subject to specific governmental regulatory supervision.\n- The Trust\u2019s obligation to reimburse the Marketing Agent and the Authorized Participants for certain liabilities in the event the Sponsor fails to indemnify such parties could adversely affect an investment in the Shares.\nDoes any of this sound like a reliable investment? Hardly. In a push-comes-to-shove environment, the risk is transferred to you. The fund is set up to protect itself before the investor. Worse, in the event any of these events take place the ETF may not even track the price of gold.\nThat\u2019s not all. You may be surprised to learn that GLD hires subcustodians to store some of their gold. But that relationship has glaring loopholes and potentially fatal flaws. Check out some of these statements from the same prospectus:\n- Under English law, neither the Trustee nor the Custodian would have a supportable breach of contract claim against a subcustodian for losses relating to the safekeeping of gold.\n- If the Trust\u2019s gold bars are lost or damaged while in the custody of a subcustodian, the Trust may not be able to recover damages from the Custodian or the subcustodian.\n- Because neither the Trustee nor the Custodian oversees or monitors the activities of subcustodians who may temporarily hold the Trust\u2019s gold bars until transported to the Custodian\u2019s London vault, failure by the subcustodians to exercise due care in the safekeeping of the Trust\u2019s gold bars could result in a loss to the Trust.\n- The Custodian is required under the Allocated Bullion Account Agreement to use reasonable care in appointing its subcustodians but otherwise has no other responsibility in relation to the subcustodians appointed by it. These subcustodians may in turn appoint further subcustodians, but the Custodian is not responsible for the appointment of these further subcustodians. The Custodian does not undertake to monitor the performance by subcustodians of their custody functions or their selection of further subcustodians. The Trustee does not undertake to monitor the performance of any subcustodian.\n- The Trustee may have no right to visit the premises of any subcustodian for the purposes of examining the Trust\u2019s gold bars or any records maintained by the subcustodian, and no subcustodian will be obligated to cooperate in any review the Trustee may wish to conduct of the facilities, procedures, records or creditworthiness of such subcustodian. The ability of the Trustee and the Custodian to take legal action against subcustodians may be limited, which increases the possibility that the Trust may suffer a loss if a subcustodian does not use due care in the safekeeping of the Trust\u2019s gold bars.\nSo let\u2019s get this straight: GLD\u2019s custodian has subcustodians\u2026 and those subcustodians can have subcustodians\u2026 and all these subcustodians can store gold without a written custody agreement\u2026 and GLD has no right to visit the storage facility\u2026 and the lack of documentation could affect the performance of the trust\u2026 and GLD has limited legal recourse?\nThis doesn\u2019t sound legal, let alone smart. It clearly makes GLD an accident waiting to happen. This \u201cchain of custody\u201d is so poorly structured that it makes the fund highly vulnerable to all kinds of mishaps.\nAll it will take is for one supplier to knock over the first domino \u2013 \u201cgee guys, we can\u2019t get our hands on the gold we were holding in the fund,\u201d for example \u2013 and the ripple effect could instantly cripple the fund and force management to freeze withdrawals. In that scenario, investors would not be able to cash out their position.\nAnd consider this: while the gold price would soar on this news, the price of the fund \u2013 and your investment \u2013 would plummet!\nThese are obvious flaws with GLD, but it\u2019s not the only risk gold ETFs face\u2026\nRisk #2: Administrative Oversights\nIf you already, rightfully, think GLD carries a lot of risk, wait until you see this\u2026\nBlackrock, the sponsor of the world\u2019s second most popular gold ETF, IAU (iShares Gold Trust), admitted in 2016 that it had failed to register new shares with the SEC. Exchange traded commodity funds are required to do this, but BlackRock reported there was an \u201cadministrative oversight\u201d and they sold shares that didn\u2019t yet exist.\nManagement claimed IAU shares continued to trade without interruption, but the reality is that management lost administrative control over the fund. They were fined by both the SEC and state securities agencies (not counting possible lawsuits from shareholders).\nAnd per usual, the chronically overburdened and understaffed SEC totally missed it. It turns out the \u201coversight\u201d only came to light because the fund itself informed the SEC. In other words, regulators weren\u2019t even aware of the violation!\nAll told, IAU sold $296 million worth of unregistered shares. The problem for investors was that until those shares were registered, the price of the fund did not track the price of gold. Imagine logging on to your account and finding the price of gold rising but the price of your gold fund falling. That\u2019s exactly what temporarily happened to IAU shareholders.\nManagement blamed a spike in demand at the time, but it was certainly no more than what we\u2019ve seen many times in the past. What happens when (not if) gold demand soars again? What if we get some sort of gold mania? And what does this say about how well equipped this management team is to handle these and other crisis-type events?\nThis blunder shows that management proficiency of this fund is lacking. All ETFs are subject to managerial skill \u2013 or lack thereof.\nMost investors were completely unaware of this development. If a stampede for the exits had started, almost none would\u2019ve got out intact.\nThe next counterparty risk may be the biggest of them all\u2026\nRisk #3: Relying on Banks\nHSBC is Britain\u2019s biggest bank. It is also the custodian for GLD, which means it buys and stores gold for the fund.\nUnbeknownst to many GLD investors, HSBC has a history rife with scandals that include predatory lending, tax evasion, and even accusations that their lack of controls helped terrorist groups and drug traffickers. Their \u201crap sheet\u201d is pretty long\u2026\n- In January 2013 HSBC paid $249 million to settle charges of foreclosure abuse\n- In March 2013 the government of Argentina filed criminal charges against the local subsidiary for helping businesses evade taxes and launder money.\n- In April 2014 the US Justice Department warned the bank needed to do more to improve its safeguards against money laundering.\n- In July 2014 the US Attorney for New York reported that HSBC would pay $10 million and admit to misconduct to settle civil fraud charges for failing to monitor reimbursement claims submitted to the federal government in connection with foreclosures on government-insured mortgages.\n- In November 2014 HSBC was fined $275 million by then CFTC and $343 million by Britain\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority for manipulating the foreign exchange market.\n- In the same month, a unit of HSBC paid $12.5 million to settle SEC charges that it failed to register with the agency before offering cross-border brokerage and investment advisory services to US clients.\n- In 2015 HSBC it was reported that on HSBC helped wealthy customers of its Swiss private banking unit evade taxes.\n- In February 2016 HSBC paid $470 million to settle abuses related to mortgage origination, servicing, and foreclosure.\n- In July 2016 one HSBC executive and a former colleague were charged with conspiracy to commit wire fraud for foreign exchange manipulation.\n- In January 2017 HSBC was fined $32.5 million for failing to comply with a 2011 order that directed the bank to overhaul its foreclosure practices.\n- In October 2018 HSBC agreed to pay $765 million to settle allegations it had covered up risks associated with mortgage-backed securities.\n- In December 2018, when Chinese telecom giant Huawei Technologies\u2019 CEO was arrested for allegedly evading US sanctions against Iran, the probe included whether HSBC conducted illegal transactions.\nDoes this sound like a bank you want to be the custodian of your gold ETF?\nThe answer is an obvious and resounding NO. And yet HSBC continues to be the cornerstone agency responsible for storing and supplying bullion for the GLD fund.\nThe thing is, most bullion ETFs also store their gold at a bank. And that is the bigger problem for investors:\n- One reason we hold gold is to protect against the banking system \u2013 and most ETFs are part of that very system!\nThis link between bullion ETFs and the banking system puts your investment at risk during an economic or monetary crisis. Bullion ETFs are vulnerable to all kinds of restrictions, emergency regulations, and even bank closures.\nWhat About Taxes?\nIf you don\u2019t know, there\u2019s an archaic US law still on the books about gold taxes. Basically, gold is taxed as a \u201ccollectible,\u201d which for most investors is currently 28%.\nAnd since bullion ETFs only hold gold, the tax rate is the same. They\u2019re generally divided into three categories: physical-backed ETFs structured as grantor trusts, such as the popular GLD. These ETFs are generally taxed as collectibles. Second are closed-end funds, also trusts that are also generally treated as collectibles. Last are securities \u201ctied to\u201d precious metals, such as mining stocks, mutual funds and mining ETFs and Exchange Traded Notes. These are generally taxed as securities.\nIn other words, there\u2019s no current tax advantage to buying a gold ETF in lieu of gold itself. You can get lots more info on taxes here. And if you\u2019re interested in tax-advantage precious metals, consider opening a Precious Metals IRA.\nThe #1 Reason to Hold PHYSICAL Gold\nAs an investor, you don\u2019t want to experience delays selling your bullion ETF or in getting proceeds paid out\u2026 or to find out the fund doesn\u2019t have the gold it thought it had\u2026 or to watch your fund fall while the gold price rises.\nAll these and more can impact the #1 reason you want to have physical gold:\n- In a crisis, it\u2019s important to be liquid.\nIn a crisis situation, you could be subject to restrictions ranging from inconvenient to disastrous:\n- Temporary bank closures and/or limited access to physical cash\n- An interruption in the electrical grid, no internet connection, or a security breach.\n- A bank bail-in, where depositor money is frozen and used to keep the bank afloat (this has already occurred in Greece).\nIf any of these or other actions take place, physical gold will give you a ready form of money to meet any financial need or emergency. You can\u2019t do these things with a gold ETF, because most don\u2019t permit delivery of bullion to retail investors (and the few that do are costly and slow). You will also have to wait on settlement, and then for a check to be mailed or funds to be wired, and that assumes the system is still functioning smoothly and can process your request exactly when you need it. And those funds will end up in the banking system anyway, which could pose another barrier to access. And all along you were merely \u201crenting\u201d a paper product that gave you little to no ability to get real gold delivered to you.\nSo, the primary reason to buy physical metal instead of a paper product is because the nature of a crisis could demand it, at least for a short time. You need more than just price exposure: you want gold in your possession to get through a crisis.\nIs Your Gold Investment a True Safe Haven?\nBullion ETFs are a nice idea, but the risks are a very real and present danger. Worse, the reason you own gold is to protect against financial and economic uncertainty \u2013 and you could lose that advantage if you own a paper form of gold that comes with all kinds of counterparty risks.\nYes, holding physical gold isn\u2019t risk free, either. But, if you hold gold Eagles and other popular bullion coins, you hold a tangible asset that has virtually no counterparty risk.\n- Physical gold, in your possession, is the most crisis-proof asset you can hold.\nAny type of crisis could put gold ETFs under greater and greater pressure, making them unable to offer safety from the very events they are supposed to protect us against.\nBuy real gold, and not a paper proxy, promise, or pawn.",

But its relevance isn\u2019t just historical \u2014 it continues to play a meaningful role in today\u2019s investment landscape as well.Here\u2019s why investors are turning their attention back to gold: \ud83d\udd38 It\u2019s a store of value \u2014 known to retain its purchasing power over the long run. \ud83d\udd38 Acts as a natural diversifier, with low correlation to both equities and debt. \ud83d\udd38 Has shown long-term growth, nearly 17x in the last two decades. \ud83d\udd38 Offers multiple ways to invest \u2014 from Gold ETFs and Sovereign Gold Bonds to traditional bullion and jewelry. \ud83d\udd38 And most importantly, it remains a hedge against global volatility.

Gold has proven its worth as a safe haven for decades. But in that rush, many are quietly missing one of the biggest opportunities of this decade \u2014 silver. \u2696\ufe0f Gold Holds the Throne, But Silver Is Catching Up While gold continues to dominate headlines, silver\u2019s performance tells a different story. Between January 2020 and September 2025, gold prices surged approximately 185%, while silver skyrocketed by over 220% \u2014 far outperforming its golden counterpart. In 2024, central banks purchased added 1045 tonnes of gold, reinforcing gold\u2019s safe-haven status. Yet, industrial demand for silver hit record highs \u2014 led by solar panels, electric vehicles, and electronics. \u2699\ufe0f Why Silver Deserves Attention 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Dual Role \u2013 Precious + Industrial Silver isn\u2019t just for jewellery or coins anymore. It\u2019s a critical component in the green and digital economy \u2014 powering solar cells, EV batteries, and semiconductors. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Demand-Supply Mismatch According to the Silver Institute, global silver demand has exceeded supply for 3 consecutive years. Solar energy alone now consumes a significant and growing portion of annual demand of total annual production. \ud83d\udca1 Investment Insight Gold provides stability during volatility. Silver offers higher growth potential during expansion. For investors aiming for balanced risk-adjusted returns, allocating even 10\u201320% of the precious metals portion to silver can enhance long-term performance. Ignoring silver because \u201cgold is safer\u201d is like ignoring mid-caps because \u201cblue-chips are stable.\u201d Sometimes, the smaller player delivers the bigger surprise. \ud83c\udfaf The Bottom Line Through this post, the aim is to: \u2705 Look beyond traditional choices and identify underappreciated asset classes. \u2705 Understand how industrial shifts create investment opportunities. \u2705 Use valuation gaps, such as the gold-silver ratio, to identify potential entry points. Knowledge doesn\u2019t reduce risk \u2014 it manages it.

Let\u2019s break down why its story matters in today\u2019s investment landscape: 1. Physical Scarcity: Global silver reserves are declining while extraction costs are rising, making supply tighter every year. 2. Industrial Demand: Silver\u2019s unique properties make it a key component in electronics, solar panels, EV batteries, and medical devices. 3. Tech Boom: The surge in green energy and digitalization is creating unprecedented industrial consumption, widening supply-demand gaps. 4. Investment Underdog: While news headlines celebrate gold\u2019s resilience, silver\u2019s price still sits far below its historic gold ratio. 5. Price Gap: The gold-silver ratio often exceeds 75:1, even though their physical availability is much narrower\u2014pointing to relative undervaluation. 6. Monetary History: Silver has played a fundamental role in monetary systems for centuries\u2014a legacy often overlooked today. 7. Portfolio Diversification: Adding silver to your portfolio reduces dependence on gold and can act as a hedge in volatile markets. 8. Volatility Advantage: Silver typically moves faster than gold during bull runs, offering higher return potential for disciplined investors. 9. Global Trends: Both retail and institutional demand for physical silver has spiked as investors look for alternatives beyond gold. 10. Supply Chain Risks: Mining constraints, trade restrictions, and recycling shortfalls create vulnerabilities in silver\u2019s global supply. My Experience: When everyone was talking about gold, I searched for the right opportunity. Ten months ago, I invested in a Silver ETF and it\u2019s delivered a whopping 80% return. Key takeaway: Don\u2019t always follow the herd. Scarcity and utility can create hidden gems in your portfolio\u2014and sometimes, silver truly shines brighter than gold. #Investing #Silver #Scarcity #ETF #PortfolioInsights #GoldVsSilver #IndustrialMetal #InvestmentStrategy\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n-\nGold vs Silver: Understanding the Correlation That Shapes Smart Investments Gold and silver have always been key players in wealth preservation\u2014but did you know their prices are closely linked, yet behave very differently? \ud83d\udcca In our latest article, we break down: -How gold and silver prices move together -Why gold remains a reliable store of value -How silver\u2019s volatility offers tactical growth opportunities -The importance of the gold\u2013silver ratio in your portfolio Whether you\u2019re a seasoned investor or just starting out, understanding these dynamics can help you make smarter investment decisions. \ud83d\udc49 Read the full article here: https://lnkd.in/gX7R5THi #Investing #Gold #Silver #WealthManagement #FinancialEducation #Fundscart #PortfolioStrategy #PreciousMetals #SmartInvesting\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n-\nSilver is sparkling again, but don\u2019t rush to buy yet Slow down for a second.

So, its demand depends on both economic growth and market sentiment. \ud835\udfd0. \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2c? A Silver ETF lets investors gain exposure to silver without holding the metal physically. Each ETF unit represents a fraction of physical silver stored in a vault and can be traded on the stock exchange like a share. Example: If 1 ETF unit = 1 gram of silver priced at \u20b9100 \u2192 NAV = \u20b9100 ETF prices may differ from their NAV: When demand exceeds supply \u2192 trades above NAV (premium) When demand is weak \u2192 trades below NAV (discount) \ud835\udfd1. \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc0d\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc1c\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc25 \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b For every new unit issued, the fund house must buy physical silver to back it. If silver is scarce or expensive, new units can\u2019t be created \u2014 limiting supply. That\u2019s when existing ETF units start trading at a premium. \ud835\udfd2. \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2b \ud835\udc04\ud835\udc13\ud835\udc05\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc1d\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc20 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc0f\ud835\udc2b\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc26\ud835\udc2c Right now, major silver ETFs are trading around 10% above their NAV. Example: If NAV = \u20b9100 \u2192 investors are paying \u20b9110. Why? Because physical silver shortages prevent fund houses from issuing new units \u2014 even as investor demand stays strong. \ud835\udfd3. \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc32 \ud835\udc13\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc22\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc07\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc29\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2c 1\ufe0f\u20e3 Investors rush to buy silver ETFs. 2\ufe0f\u20e3 Fund houses can\u2019t source enough silver to issue new units. 3\ufe0f\u20e3 ETF units become scarce. 4\ufe0f\u20e3 Prices rise above NAV \u2014 creating a premium. \ud835\udfd4. \ud835\udc16\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2d \ud835\udc12\ud835\udc21\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e\ud835\udc25\ud835\udc1d \ud835\udc18\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2e \ud835\udc03\ud835\udc28 \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc2c \ud835\udc1a\ud835\udc27 \ud835\udc08\ud835\udc27\ud835\udc2f\ud835\udc1e\ud835\udc2c\ud835\udc2d\ud835\udc28\ud835\udc2b? \u2705 Avoid chasing silver ETFs during this overheated phase. \u2705 Wait until prices align with NAV. \u2705 Track industrial trends \u2014 silver\u2019s long-term story depends on clean energy and technology demand, not short-term frenzy. \ud835\udc70\ud835\udc8f \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc97\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc94\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc88, \ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\u2019\ud835\udc94 \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc93 \ud835\udc95\ud835\udc90 \ud835\udc83\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc9a \ud835\udc97\ud835\udc82\ud835\udc8d\ud835\udc96\ud835\udc86, \ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc90\ud835\udc95 \ud835\udc86\ud835\udc99\ud835\udc84\ud835\udc8a\ud835\udc95\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8e\ud835\udc86\ud835\udc8f\ud835\udc95. #silveretf P.S. - I write to make you a better investor, you can follow me at Arpit Jain\nTo view or add a comment, sign in",

      "content": "Two common ways to invest in silver are purchasing shares of silver ETFs and buying and selling physical silver. Silver ETFs are a smart portfolio addition for some, but physical silver may provide more peace of mind and practical advantages for many investors.\nWhat Is Physical Silver?\nPhysical silver refers to tangible forms of silver, such as coins, bars, rounds, and bullion, which investors can hold and store themselves. Silver is a tangible store of wealth and has been used as money, a medium of exchange, and a store of value for thousands of years across numerous civilizations.\nIt\u2019s best to invest in physical silver when there is high inflation, low interest rates, or geopolitical instability. Investors should avoid purchasing silver collectible coins and instead focus on silver bullion coins, such as the American Silver Eagle or the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf.\nPurchasing silver bars is another option for investing in physical silver. Silver bars typically carry lower premiums than coins or rounds. Bars are ideal for bulk storage because they are stackable and space-efficient. Larger silver bars are more cost-effective due to lower premiums over the spot price per ounce.\nWhat is a Silver ETF?\nSilver exchange-traded funds, or silver ETFs, track the price of silver and are bought like stocks. They invest primarily in physical silver, futures contracts, or silver mining stocks. Silver ETFs aim to mirror the price movements of silver by holding either physical bullion or securities related to the silver industry. They provide investors with a convenient and relatively low-cost way to gain exposure to silver without the responsibility of physical ownership or storage. Investors do not own the silver through an ETF, but rather through shares of a fund.\nSilver ETFs typically come with annual fees, which are calculated as a percentage of your total holdings. Expense ratios typically range from 0.30% to 0.50% for most silver ETFs, covering storage, insurance, and administrative costs. Additionally, brokerage commissions may apply when buying or selling shares.\nPhysically Backed Silver ETFs & Authorized Participants\nPhysically backed silver ETFs, such as SLV, hold silver bullion in secure vaults. The value of each share is linked to the spot price of silver, minus the fund\u2019s management and operating expenses. When investors purchase shares of these ETFs, they gain indirect exposure to silver through a fractional interest in the trust that holds the physical metal.\nHowever, individual retail investors cannot exchange ETF shares for physical silver.\nRedemption rights are reserved for Authorized Participants (APs), which are typically large financial institutions such as major banks, broker-dealers, or market makers. These APs have agreements with the ETF sponsor and can create or redeem shares in large blocks, usually a minimum of 50,000 shares. This structure helps maintain price alignment between the ETF and the underlying silver but limits access to physical metal for individual investors.\nIf tangible ownership is important to you, buying physical silver directly is a better option.\nSilver ETF Risks\nThe price of silver can be highly volatile. Factors like industrial demand, currency fluctuations, and investor sentiment can lead to significant price swings and are subject to market risks, including changes in interest rates, inflation expectations, market prices, and global economic conditions.\nETFs might not perfectly mirror the price of silver due to fees, expenses, and the potential for slight discrepancies between the silver price and the ETF\u2019s actual holdings or contracts.\nKey Differences Between Silver ETFs and Physical Silver\nOwnership\n- Physical silver = full, personal ownership.\n- ETFs = indirect exposure; ownership is mediated through institutions.\nSecurity and Storage\n- Physical silver needs to be stored securely in a home safe, bank deposit box, or private vault. You control where and how your silver is stored.\n- ETFs have storage handled by custodians, which adds convenience at the expense of transparency.\nTransaction Costs\n- Physical silver typically includes premiums over the spot price, as well as possible shipping fees.\n- ETFs may have lower upfront costs, but ongoing management fees (which cover the expenses of operating and managing the fund) and brokerage commissions (the transaction fee paid to your broker each time you place a trade) generate ongoing expenses.\nCrisis Resilience\n- Physical silver can be used or traded even in economic emergencies, power outages, or system failures.\n- ETFs depend on market, broker, and digital access, making them vulnerable in high-stress scenarios.\nLiquidity\n- Physical silver can be sold online or in person. Investors should choose a platform they can trust.\n- Investors can buy or sell silver ETF shares on stock exchanges at any time during market hours.\nHistorical Performance: Returns and Resilience\nValue of Silver and Silver ETFs in Wartime Climates\nThroughout history, silver has often been regarded as a safe haven during times of war and inflation. However, geopolitical influences can negatively impact the price of silver, and performance during each conflict varies. War can drive up the cost of silver due to increased government spending and industrial demand, as well as investor sentiment and supply constraints. Silver also has applications in military technology, including rockets, missiles, satellites, and nuclear systems.\nLike physical silver, silver ETFs are generally considered safe-haven assets in times of war or stress events. If internet or digital access is compromised, however, only physical silver provides direct access to assets.\nMarket Crashes and Stress Events\nHigh inflation and economic stagnation pushed silver prices from $1.75 per ounce in 1971 to $49.45 per ounce in 1980, partly due to attempts by Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt to corner the silver market.\nDuring the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, silver rose from $9 per ounce in 2008 to nearly $50 by 2011 as investors sought protection from inflation. In the COVID-19 Pandemic from 2020 to 2022, stimulus spending and inflation concerns drove silver prices to $28 \u2013 $29 per ounce in 2020, as demand for safe-haven assets surged.\nSilver ETFs, whose value is based entirely on physical metal deposits, have maintained their value. These silver ETFs mirror price movements in silver, reflecting both gains and declines, as seen in 2008, 2011, and 2020-2022. Other ETFs or ETNs, designed to serve a specific purpose, such as leveraged ETFs, silver miner ETFs, or ETNs, have not always maintained their value, especially when compared to the performance of spot silver.\nWhy Some Investors Prefer Physical Silver\nWith physical silver, investors have direct control over storage and can physically hold their assets, which some prefer for transparency and security. In a world of increasing digital and financial uncertainty, many investors find value in owning something tangible, a form of wealth they can see, touch, and store themselves.\nThat sense of control extends to understanding how holdings perform. The silver return calculator\nprovides a straightforward way to measure the melt value growth of your physical silver over time based on spot price movements. For investors seeking a long-term hedge against economic uncertainty, physical silver can play an important role within a diversified portfolio.\nIf you do not want to manage assets through a brokerage account, silver ETFs may not be the best choice. However, if you prefer a hands-off online experience, ETFs can be a suitable alternative.\nAdding silver, whether in physical or ETF form, can help diversify an investment portfolio and potentially reduce overall risk. Market performance varies, and all investments carry risks, so it is important to choose the best investment option for your financial goals.",
