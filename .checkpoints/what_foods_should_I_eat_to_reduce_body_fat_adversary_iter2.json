      "title": "14 Foods You Should Eat to Lose Weight - AARP",
      "content": "4. Broccoli\nGreen heads of broccoli are available year-round, mild in taste and, best of all, beneficial in weight loss. Water accounts for more than 90 percent of broccoli\u2019s content. Carbs, protein and a little fat make up the rest. Broccoli, like other nonstarchy vegetables, is low in calories (about 35 per cup) and rich in fiber, making it a filling food that can help control weight. The leaves and stems of broccoli are nutritious, but the florets have an even higher concentration of nutrients and phytochemicals, naturally occurring chemical compounds produced by plants. However, you may want to introduce broccoli into your diet slowly; it has been known to increase intestinal gas and flatulence.\n5. Fish\nFor older adults looking to cut calories from fattier meats, fish\u2014especially canned varieties packed in water\u2014can be a great option. It\u2019s loaded with omega-3 fats, rich in nutrients like vitamin D and selenium, high in protein, and low in saturated fat.\nIncluding one to two 3-ounce servings of fatty fish per week, such as salmon, herring, mackerel, anchovies, and sardines, may lower the risk of dying from heart disease by 36%, according to a JAMA review of 20 studies.\n6. Carrots\nForget the Bugs Bunny jokes, it\u2019s time to take carrots seriously. Research suggests that including fiber-rich carrots in your diet helps curb your appetite. If you want to lose weight, eat food that contains more water and fewer calories. Here\u2019s where carrots come in. A medium raw carrot is about 88 percent water and contains only 25 calories. If you\u2019ve had enough of orange carrots, the most popular color, you can also find red, purple, yellow and white carrots.\n7. Cottage cheese\nPeople generally don\u2019t think of cottage cheese as sophisticated or suave or worldly. But its lumpy looks hide a world of benefits, according to dietitian Julia Zumpano, of the Cleveland Clinic. Forget Swiss cheese or cheddar and head straight for cottage cheese, she advises. It\u2019s high in protein, which helps curb your appetite and manage hormones associated with appetite and digestion. And, believe it or not, cottage cheese has become trendy. For those with lactose intolerance, cottage cheese has lower levels than many dairy foods, and lactose-free cottage cheese is available.\n8. Eggs\nWhether you scramble them, hard-boil them or coddle them, eggs are a great way to start the day if you\u2019re trying to take off extra pounds. They\u2019re low in calories and packed with protein, which takes longer to digest, leaving you feeling satisfied and less likely to overeat at your next meal. An Australian study that provided either a breakfast of eggs and toast or cereal with milk and orange juice to overweight or obese men and women found that those who ate the egg breakfast felt less hungry and ate significantly less at lunch. Those concerned about their cholesterol may want to avoid or limit eating egg yolks and enjoy egg whites instead. For example, try an omelet with three egg whites and just one egg yolk.\n9. Lentils and other pulses\nLentils, chickpeas, beans and peas all belong to a plant family called legumes with edible seeds known as pulses. Eating about one serving a day of these nutritionally dense seeds promotes a feeling of satiety, a term researchers use when they mean a person has eaten enough to feel full. This satiety may lead to weight loss and better weight management. According to a study from the University of Toronto, participants lost an average of \u00be of a pound over six weeks by simply adding less than a cup of these seeds to their regular diet. Even more important, this modest amount seemed to prevent them from gaining it back.\n10. Mushrooms\nAdd sauteed mushrooms to your scrambled eggs in the morning for a great way to start the day. \u201cMushrooms can be an important part of a diet that helps with weight loss,\u201d says Andrea Glenn, a postdoctoral research fellow at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. Highly nutritious mushrooms contribute a savory flavor called umami to food without much in the way of fat or calories, so they may help people feel full for few calories, Glenn notes.\n11. Oats\nOatmeal, a soothing, old-fashioned breakfast standby, doesn\u2019t look like much, but it packs a mighty punch. People who eat cooked oatmeal regularly have a lower risk of becoming overweight. A cup of cooked oatmeal contains about 160 calories \u2014 not much \u2014 and nearly 4 grams of a soluble fiber called beta-glucan, which encourages a feeling of fullness and dampens the urge to overeat. To add pizzazz to your morning bowl of oatmeal, dress it up with apple slices, fresh berries and chopped nuts. Be cautious about \u201cinstant\u201d oatmeal, which tends to be processed and could contain added sugar and sodium and less fiber content.\n12. Nuts\nContrary to what you might expect, studies associate consuming nuts of all kinds with less weight gain. A study in the journal Nutrients determined that eating more nuts may help prevent long-term weight gain. In particular, Brazil nuts contain the mineral selenium, which may improve the health of your thyroid, which regulates metabolism. However, nuts are packed with calories, so portion control is key; aim for about a handful.\n13. Pears\nPears come in all shapes \u2014 round and plump, chubby, knobby as fists and, of course, pear-shaped. No matter what the fruit looks like, researchers concluded that men and women who made pears part of their everyday diet had a lower body weight than those who ignored them. The people who ate pears were 35 percent less likely to be obese, and their diets were of higher quality. The study, published in Nutrition & Food Science, noted that people who ate pears had higher-than-usual intakes of dietary fiber, vitamin C, magnesium, copper and potassium, all of them important for the body to function well.\n14. Leafy Greens\nArugula, romaine lettuce, spinach, kale, \u2018spring mix,\u2019 and other leafy greens are an excellent way to pack in nutrients without adding many calories. Even better for weight loss, they\u2019re high in fiber, which helps keep you feeling full longer by slowing digestion, says Rush University System in Chicago.\n4 Foods that sabotage weight-loss plans\nIf you\u2019re trying to lose weight, beware of the hidden calories in these supposed \u201chealth foods.\u201d\nHere are four to avoid, courtesy of Emory University:\nFruit-flavored yogurt\nAlthough yogurt is a healthy addition to a weight-loss diet, flavored yogurt is often boosted with added sugar \u2014 as much as 31 grams to a 6-ounce container. That\u2019s almost 8 teaspoons of sugar! Ouch!\nFast-food salads\nBeware the toppings on prepackaged salads. The dressings and add-ons can rack up as much as 500 unwanted calories.\nEnhanced water\nThese drinks marketed as water typically contain artificial flavors and sweeteners.\nRefined grains\nWhole grains provide a ton of health benefits. They contain all parts of the grain, including fiber, B vitamins and essential fatty acids. But once the grain is refined to make it easier to use in cookies, cakes and breads, it leaves only the endosperm, which is nutrient-poor starch. Read the label and look for the word \u201cwhole\u201d before the grain listed.\nIn addition, stay away from:\n- Commercially baked cookies and cakes, which are often high in fructose, a type of sugar that can reduce feelings of fullness and increase your desire to eat.\n- Fried foods and potato chips, including commercial french fries, which may taste good but won\u2019t fill you up for long.\n- Candy bars \u2014 well, you knew that.\nHow to add weight-loss foods to your diet\nKeep fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods you enjoy on hand for easy snacks and meals, says Hawkins. To avoid spoilage, consider stocking up on frozen fruits and vegetables.\nCanned fruits and vegetables are another good shelf-stable option, as long as they\u2019re free of added sugar or salt. Tip: Rinsing canned foods before using them can help wash away excess sodium and preservatives.\n\u201cI love a hearty salad that includes a green vegetable, a whole grain or starchy vegetable, beans, lentils, or nuts, and healthy fats,\u201d Hawkins adds. \u201cFor example, a salad with finely chopped kale, roasted sweet potatoes, toasted walnuts, goat cheese, and a vinaigrette makes a delicious combination. For a complete meal, you could serve it with a salmon fillet.\u201d\nSoups and stews are another great way to assemble a balanced meal\u2014plus, they\u2019re budget-friendly if you use leftovers. Think chili with lean ground beef or turkey, beans, and fresh or canned produce paired with a whole grain.\nHow to find your ideal portion size\nFor personalized guidance, consider asking your doctor or dietitian for nutrition counseling. Medicare even covers medical nutrition therapy for patients with diabetes or kidney disease.\n\u201cListening to your body\u2019s hunger and fullness cues is helpful so that you\u2019re eating when hungry and stopping when full,\u201d says Hawkins.\nFor general tips, Hawkins suggests using MyPlate.gov as a resource for understanding food groups and serving sizes tailored to different calorie needs.\n\u201cGenerally, I recommend making half your plate fruits and vegetables, a quarter lean protein, and a quarter starch to create a filling meal without going overboard on calories,\u201d she adds.",

      "title": "9 Superfoods for Weight Loss, According to Dietitians - Lose It!",
      "content": "If you want to shed extra pounds, eating more weight-loss-friendly superfoods is a great place to start. While no specific criteria defines \u201csuperfood\u201d status, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health describes superfoods as nutrient-rich foods that help protect against disease or offer health benefits beyond their nutritional value.\nSuperfoods bring a host of nutrients to the table to help you manage your weight, including protein and fiber. \u201cWhen it comes to weight loss, feeling full and staying full is the aim of the game, and foods high in protein and fiber are \u2018super\u2019 at doing this,\u201d says Maria Lucey, a registered dietitian based in Cork, Ireland. Research shows that both of these nutrients can increase satiety to help supercharge your weight loss.\nRead on to discover nine of the top superfoods for weight loss, along with simple ideas to add them to your diet, according to dietitians.\n1. Leafy Greens\nLeafy greens \u2014 like kale, spinach, and cabbage \u2014 contain many nutrients that help support both weight loss and overall health, says Nichole Dandrea-Russert, RDN, co-author of Powered by Plants, who is based in Atlanta. \u201cLeafy greens are low in calories, high in fiber, and ultra high in vitamins, minerals, and phytochemicals,\u201d she says, echoing information on the benefits of greens from Harvard Health.\nThe fiber content in greens could also help you feel fuller for longer, which may lead to weight loss, per Dandrea-Russert and research. A study also found that swapping one daily serving of starchy foods with leafy greens led to a significant drop in body fat and waist circumference after just three months. Examples of starchy foods are grains, legumes, peas, and potatoes, per the American Diabetes Association.\n\u201cHide leafy greens in smoothies, stir them into soups, or toss a variety of greens into a bowl to create a nutrient-dense salad base,\u201d suggests Dandrea-Russert.\nLeafy greens pair perfectly with eggs (another superfood for weight loss!) in these Sweet Potato and Spinach Egg Muffins. If you\u2019re short on time, a powdered greens supplement can occasionally help fill in the gaps.\n2. Seafood\n\u201cSeafood is another powerful food to consume when you are trying to lose weight,\u201d says Stephanie Crabtree, RD, owner of Holistic Health RD in Sarasota, Florida. \u201cIt is high in iodine, which contributes to healthy thyroid function and hormone levels,\u201d she adds, echoing information from the National Institutes of Health. Crabtree notes that seafood provides omega-3 fatty acids, which may help support fat loss when coupled with a weight loss diet, per research.\nYou can enjoy tuna straight out of the can with a sprinkle of seasoning and easily add it to sandwiches, salads, and pasta dishes. You can also bake, grill, or sear other types of seafood, such as salmon, for a filling main meal.\nIf you need some ideas to help get you going, try making Shrimp Curry or Grilled Cod With Kiwi-Cucumber Salsa, or this Teriyaki Baked Salmon, which requires just five ingredients and takes only 35 minutes from start to finish.\n3. Berries\nNutrient-dense berries, like strawberries, blueberries, and blackberries, are \u201cpacked with polyphenols and fiber, both of which gut bacteria love,\u201d says Dandrea-Russert, supported by research. Studies of individuals with metabolic syndrome suggest that the polyphenols found in berries could even aid weight management by blocking the absorption of fat, boosting metabolism, and decreasing food intake.\nUse berries to give French toast an instant upgrade, whip up a batch of Blueberry Zucchini Muffins, or make one of these low-calorie strawberry desserts.\n4. Avocados\nWhen it comes to superfoods and weight loss, avocados make an excellent choice, says Brittany Pardue, RD, a clinical dietitian at Memorial Hermann Health System, who is based in Kemah, Texas. \u201cAvocados are rich in monounsaturated fats and fiber, which can help you feel fuller longer,\u201d she explains.\nA study showed that eating one avocado per day for 26 weeks helped enhance diet quality by increasing total vegetable intake and improving the ratio of heart-healthy fats consumed compared to a control group. Increasing your intake of monounsaturated fats from avocados might also be helpful for weight loss. In fact, a study found that following a diet rich in monounsaturated fat led to reductions in body weight, body fat, and belly fat in women with obesity.\nBesides being highly nutritious, avocados are versatile. \u201cAvocados can be sliced on top of scrambled eggs, added to a lunchtime sandwich, or chopped into your dinner salad,\u201d says Pardue.\nBelieve it or not, avocados are delicious in desserts, too, like in these Healthier Avocado Chocolate Truffles or Fudgy Avocado Brownies.\n5. Lean Meat\n\u201cWhen it comes to weight loss, one key nutrient not to overlook is protein, particularly lean protein,\u201d says Lucey. Lean meats like chicken, turkey, or pork can easily fit into a high-protein diet for weight loss.\n\u201cHigher-protein diets help you feel fuller for longer, reducing the likelihood of mindless snacking or overeating,\u201d says Lucey, aligning with research. \u201cMoreover, protein can influence hunger hormones. It reduces the release of ghrelin, the hormone that signals hunger, while boosting hormones that promote feelings of fullness.\u201d\nNeed some ideas for how to ramp up your intake of lean meat? Check out our Mango Chicken Salad, Lightened Up Turkey and Wild Rice Soup, or Apple Cider Pork Loin to add more protein to your menu.\n6. Whole Grains\n\u201cWhole grains are understated in many consumer\u2019s minds because of the fear of carbohydrates,\u201d says Dandrea-Russert. \u201cHowever, carbohydrates are essential for health.\u201d According to Dandrea-Russert and the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, adding whole grains (such as quinoa, oats, or whole wheat) to your meal plan may promote digestive health, ease inflammation, and support a healthy metabolism.\nReplacing refined grains with whole grains in your diet helps give you the most bang for your bite. One meta-analysis notes that whole grains are high in fiber, which can slow the emptying of the stomach and promote satiety. Researchers also note that whole grains are harder to digest than refined grains and have less impact on blood sugar and insulin levels, which may be linked to a lower risk of type 2 diabetes. Meanwhile, other observational studies suggest that eating more whole grains could be linked to less weight gain over time (although this was not confirmed by randomized controlled trials).\nGet your fix of whole grains by enjoying brown rice, barley, or bulgur as a side dish alongside your main meal. Or start your morning strong with a Chocolate Quinoa Breakfast Bowl or a serving of Protein-Packed Overnight Oats.\n7. Eggs\nCracking open an egg or two can start your day on the right foot, especially if weight loss is your goal. Versatile and delicious, eggs contain lots of important nutrients, including 5.5 grams of protein per medium egg, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\nEating more protein in the morning helps you feel fuller for longer and sets you up to eat less the rest of the day, says Crabtree. She cites a study that found that swapping breakfast cereal for eggs could lead to less hunger and decreased food intake later during lunch.\nYou can enjoy eggs in many ways beyond beloved breakfast staples like omelets and frittatas. \u201cI like to take my leftover roasted veggies, rice, or potatoes; add some leafy greens; and put an egg on top for a power-packed lunch when I work from home,\u201d says Crabtree.\nTo bump up the benefits even more, combine eggs with one of the other superfoods on this list \u2014 salmon \u2014 for Green Eggs and Salmon Ceviche.\n8. Apples\nNot only can an apple a day help keep the doctor away, but it might help you lose weight, too. Like berries, apples contain polyphenols and satiety-boosting fiber, Dandrea-Russert says, and research suggests these features can help regulate appetite.\nIf weight loss is your goal, you might choose whole apples in particular: One study found that whole apples slowed the emptying of the stomach and increased feelings of fullness more effectively than juices or purees.\nApples work well coupled with cheese, paired with peanut butter, or simply enjoyed as is. They can also add flavor to your favorite recipes, like this Spiced Apple Baked Oatmeal; Carrot, Apple, and Ginger Soup; or Sweet and Savory Apple Chip Nachos.\n9. Greek Yogurt\nGreek yogurt benefits both your gut and your waistline, says Pardue. \u201cGreek yogurt is well known to contain probiotics, healthy bacteria that are important for regulating the digestive system,\u201d she explains.\nResearch suggests that your gut microbiome could impact the development of obesity and that upping your intake of probiotics could aid weight loss. In one meta-analysis, researchers reported that each 50-gram increase in daily yogurt intake was tied to a 13 percent lower risk of overweight or obesity.\nMix Greek yogurt with fresh fruit and top it off with your favorite nuts or seeds for a filling breakfast or snack. Greek yogurt can also help ramp up the health benefits of sweet treats, like in this Greek Yogurt Gingerbread Loaf.\nThe Wrap-Up\nSuperfoods are nutritious ingredients that can promote overall health, and adding more to your plate is a smart move if you\u2019re trying to lose weight. That\u2019s because superfoods tend to be high in vitamins and minerals, as well as nutrients like protein and fiber, which studies show can support weight loss efforts. To begin reaping the potential benefits of superfoods, enjoy them alone, paired together, or as part of your favorite meals and snacks.\nEditorial Resources and Fact-Checking\n- Superfoods or Superhype?

      "content": "Key points\n- Fruits and vegetables provide essential vitamins and minerals, fiber, and other substances important for good health.\n- Incorporating more fruits and vegetables is a healthy way to lose or maintain weight.\nTo lose weight, eat fewer calories than your body uses\nLosing weight doesn't necessarily mean that you have to eat less food. You can create lower-calorie versions of some of your favorite dishes by substituting low-calorie fruits and vegetables in place of higher-calorie ingredients.\nMost fruits and vegetables are naturally low in fat and calories. The water and fiber in fruits and vegetables will add volume to your dishes so you can eat the same amount of food with fewer calories. This means you can feel full while eating fewer calories.\nEat more fruits and vegetables throughout the day\nBreakfast \u2014 start the day right\nSubstitute spinach, onions, or mushrooms for one egg or half the cheese in your morning omelet. The vegetables will add volume and flavor to the dish with fewer calories than the egg or cheese.\nCut back on the amount of cereal in your bowl to make room for bananas, peaches, or strawberries. You can still eat a full bowl of food but with fewer calories.\nLighten up your lunch\nSubstitute vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, or cucumbers for some of the cheese and meat in your sandwich, wrap, or burrito. Or, replace 2 ounces of meat or 1 cup of noodles in soup with 1 cup of chopped vegetables, such as broccoli, carrots, beans, or red peppers. The new version will fill you up with fewer calories than the original.\nDinner\nReplace 1 cup of rice or pasta in your favorite dish with 1 cup of vegetables such as broccoli, squash, or peppers. The dish with the vegetables will be just as satisfying but have fewer calories than the same amount of the original version.\nTake a good look at your dinner plate. Vegetables, fruit, and whole grains should take up the largest portion of your plate. If they do not, replace some of the meat, cheese, white pasta, or rice with legumes, steamed broccoli, asparagus, greens, or another favorite vegetable. This will reduce the total calories in your meal without reducing the amount of food you eat.\nRemember to use a normal- or small-size plate \u2014 not a platter. The total number of calories you eat counts, even if a good proportion of them come from fruits and vegetables.\nSmart snacks\nInstead of high-calorie snacks such as corn chips, take healthy snacks with you when you're on the go. If you are aiming for snacks with 100 calories or less, consider:\n- A medium apple (72 calories)\n- A medium banana (105 calories)\n- One cup steamed green beans (44 calories)\n- One cup blueberries (83 calories)\n- One cup grapes (100 calories)\n- Two tablespoons of hummus (46 calories) with:\n- 1 cup carrots (45 calories)\n- 1 cup broccoli (30 calories) or\n- 1 cup bell peppers (30 calories)\nMore tips\nEat fruits and vegetables uncooked or with fat-free or low-fat cooking techniques. Try steaming your vegetables, using low-calorie or low-fat dressings, and using herbs and spices to add flavor. Some cooking techniques, such as breading and frying, or using high-fat dressings or sauces will greatly increase the calories and fat in the dish. Also, eating raw fruit lets you enjoy its natural sweetness.\nCanned or frozen fruits and vegetables are also good options. Frozen or canned fruits and vegetables can be just as nutritious as the fresh varieties. However, be careful to choose those without added sugar, syrup, cream sauces, or other ingredients that will add calories.\nChoose whole fruits over fruit drinks and juices. Fruit juices have lost fiber from the fruit. It is better to eat the whole fruit because it contains the added fiber that helps you feel full.\nWhole fruit gives you a bigger snack than dried fruit. For example, a small box of raisins (1/4 cup) is about 100 calories. For the same number of calories, you can eat 1 cup of grapes and feel more full.\nSubstitution is key\nWhile fruits and vegetables are lower in calories than many other foods, they do contain some calories. If you start eating fruits and vegetables in addition to what you usually eat, you are adding calories and may gain weight. The key is substitution. Eat fruits and vegetables instead of some other higher-calorie food.\nResources\nCut Down on Added Sugars offers ways to cut back on added sugar.\nMyPlate Plan provides tips for developing a personalized plan within your food preferences, health goals, and budget.\nStart Simple with MyPlate app helps you pick simple daily food goals and see real-time progress.",

You focus on overall eating patterns rather than following strict formulas or calculations.\nAdvertisement\nCleveland Clinic is a non-profit academic medical center.

Researchers have linked these eating patterns with a reduced risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). Today, healthcare providers recommend this eating plan if you have risk factors for heart disease or to support other aspects of your health.\nA dietitian can help you modify your approach as needed based on your medical history, underlying conditions, allergies and preferences.\nThe Mediterranean Diet has many benefits, including:\nAdvertisement\nThe Mediterranean Diet has these benefits because it:\nThe Mediterranean Diet includes many different nutrients that work together to help your body. There\u2019s no single food or ingredient responsible for the Mediterranean Diet\u2019s benefits. Instead, the diet is healthy for you because of the combination of nutrients it provides.\nThink of a choir with many people singing. One voice alone might carry part of the tune, but you need all the voices to come together to achieve the full effect. Similarly, the Mediterranean Diet works by giving you an ideal blend of nutrients that harmonize to support your health.\nThe Mediterranean Diet encourages you to eat plenty of some foods (like whole grains and vegetables) while limiting others. If you\u2019re planning a grocery store trip, you might wonder which foods to buy. Here are some examples of foods to eat often with the Mediterranean Diet.\nA fridge and pantry full of nutritious foods are great for starters. But where do you go from there? How much of each food do you need? It\u2019s always best to talk to a dietitian to get advice tailored to your needs as you get started. The chart below offers some general guidance on serving goals and serving sizes, according to the type of food.\nIt\u2019s important to consult with a primary care physician (PCP) or dietitian before making drastic changes to your diet or trying any new eating plan. They\u2019ll make sure your intended plan is best for you based on your individual needs. They may also share meal plans and recipes for you to try at home.\nAdvertisement\nIn general, when thinking about meals, you\u2019ll want to collect some go-to options and recipes for breakfasts, lunches, dinners and snacks. The more variety, the better. You don\u2019t want to get stuck in a rut or feel like you\u2019re restricted in which foods you can or should eat. Luckily, there\u2019s plenty of room for changing things up with the Mediterranean Diet. Below are some examples of meals you might enjoy.\nGet your day going strong with breakfasts like:\nFor midday nutrition and a powerful energy boost, consider:\nYou may want to prepare some lunches the day before so they\u2019re ready to pack or grab from the fridge as needed.\nWrap up the day with a hearty, nutrient-packed entree like:\nAdvertisement\nFor some added nutrients and color, throw together a side salad \u2014 like a sesame cucumber salad or a fennel, orange and mint salad. To keep things simple, try drizzling mixed greens with a nutritious Mediterranean dressing.\nPortion and prepare snacks ahead of time so they\u2019re ready when you need them. Here are some ideas of what to keep at the ready:\nThe Mediterranean Diet doesn\u2019t set hard and fast rules for what you\u2019re allowed or not allowed. Rather, it encourages you to eat more of certain foods and limit others. Here\u2019s what you should try to limit as much as possible:\nThe Mediterranean Diet pyramid is one way to visualize what foods you should eat and how often. Different organizations have created slightly different versions of this pyramid. All Mediterranean Diet pyramids encourage you to eat mostly veggies, fruits, whole grains and extra virgin olive oil while limiting red meat and sweets.\nAdvertisement\nThe Mediterranean Diet pyramid is different from the Food Guide Pyramid that the U.S. government created in the 1990s.\nTo get the most from your eating plan, try to:\nYes. If you prefer a vegetarian diet, you can easily modify the Mediterranean Diet to exclude meat and fish. In that case, you\u2019d gain your protein solely from plant sources like nuts and beans. Talk to a dietitian to learn more.\nYes. You can modify recipes to exclude gluten-based products. Talk to a dietitian for recipe ideas and support in making necessary changes.\nRegular olive oil is a good alternative to an oil that\u2019s high in saturated fat (like palm oil). However, to get the most benefits, opt for extra virgin olive oil.\nA crucial fact to know before starting the Mediterranean Diet is that not all olive oils are the same. The Mediterranean Diet calls for extra virgin olive oil (EVOO), specifically. That\u2019s because it has a healthy fat ratio. This means EVOO contains more healthy fat (unsaturated) than unhealthy fat (saturated). Aside from its fat ratio, EVOO is healthy because it\u2019s high in antioxidants.\nAntioxidants help protect your cells from damage, therefore protecting your heart and brain and reducing inflammation throughout your body. Because it\u2019s manufactured differently, regular olive oil doesn\u2019t contain as many of these antioxidants.\nIn a world with endless diet options, it can be hard to know which one is right for you. Research has proven the benefits of the Mediterranean Diet for many people, especially those at risk for heart disease. Beyond protecting your heart, the Mediterranean Diet can help you prevent or manage many other conditions.\nAs with any eating plan, it\u2019s important to talk to a healthcare provider before getting started. They\u2019ll make sure the plan is appropriate for you and help you modify it as needed. Also, tell your loved ones about your goals. Invite them to cook and share meals with you. It\u2019s easier to follow an eating plan over the long term when you have a supportive community with you along the way.\nCleveland Clinic\u2019s primary care providers offer lifelong medical care.

      "title": "26 Fat-Fighting Foods to Energize You - Santiam Hospital",
      "content": "embrace health\nI recently talked to a group at Santiam Hospital & Clinics about changing habits in favor of a more active, healthy lifestyle.\nIn addition to exercise, I suggest not to forget about the importance of good nutrition. Below are 26 foods that can help you lose weight.\n\u2013 Dr. Amy Sutkus\n1. Greek yogurt\nGreek yogurt packs a healthy punch with twice as much protein as other yogurts. Since the body burns more calories digesting protein than it does digesting carbs, Greek yogurt is an efficient choice when you\u2019re hoping to lose weight.\n2. Quinoa\nOne cup of this whole grain has 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber,\nalong with a multitude of other nutrients such as zinc, iron, and vitamin E.\nIts ease of preparation and the variety of ways it can be used makes it a\nversatile choice for any mealtime.\n3. Cinnamon\nCinnamon has surprising benefits \u2014 especially for those with type 2 diabetes. According to recent studies, cinnamon may play a part in stabilizing blood sugar levels, which can help satisfy hunger. Sprinkle some in your morning coffee or yogurt for some additional 0-calorie sweetness.\n4.Hot peppers\nThe key to the benefits of hot peppers lies in a flavorless compound they contain, called capsaicin. The compound is especially plentiful in habaneros but also can be found in jalepenos. Capsaicin\u2019s ability to curb appetite and speed up the metabolism makes these peppers a useful \u2014 and flavorful \u2014 addition to your diet.\n5. Green tea\nStudies suggest that green tea stimulates the body to burn abdominal fat. Drinking this fat-fighter several times per day will provide the most benefit.\n6. Grapefruit\nGrapefruit is a low-calorie fruit with lots of soluble fiber. This takes longer to digest, and, when eaten before a meal, can help fill you up so that you eat fewer calories during mealtime.\n7. Watermelon\nFoods with high water content serve as a signal to the stomach that you\u2019ve had enough to eat. Watermelon, among other raw fruits and vegetables, is filled with plenty of water and nutrients such as lycopene and vitamins C and A.\n8. Pears and apples\nPears and apples are examples of other fruits that include a high volume of water content. When eaten with the peels, they also are a great source of fiber, which keeps you full longer.\n9. Grapes vs. raisins\nSpeaking of water content, compare two cups of grapes with \u00bc cup of raisins. Both choices are around 100 calories, but the larger portion of grapes will likely feel more satisfying as a snack.\n10. Berries\nBesides their high water and fiber content, berries also have the added benefit\nof their sweetness. They can satisfy your sweet tooth at a fraction of the calories\nyou\u2019d find in baked goods, ice cream or candy.\n11. Raw vegetables\nRaw vegetables satisfy the craving for something crunchy, and they, too,\nare full of water to help you feel full. Most also are low in calories and\ncan be adapted for many meals and snacks to replace many less-healthy options.\n12. Sweet potatoes\nNext time you crave a baked potato with all the fixings, consider baking a sweet potato instead. Since sweet potatoes are so much more flavorful, they can more easily be eaten without the typical sour cream, cheese, butter and bacon bits, all very high in fat.\n13. Eggs\nStudies have shown that consuming protein in the morning helps to keep you full throughout the day. Eggs are low in calories, but pack a lot of protein and other vital nutrients. Eating eggs in lieu of toast or other carbs will help your body burn more calories.\n14. Coffee\nYes, coffee! It may sound too good to be true, but coffee may actually help speed up your metabolism and help you lose weight. However, take caution: Its fat-fighting effects can be canceled out when you add the extra calories of creamer and whipped cream.\n15. Oatmeal\nThe benefits of oatmeal are threefold: Its whole-grain oats make it rich in fiber, it has a high water content and it is served hot. Hot food takes longer to consume, and that combined with the water and fiber will keep you feeling satisfied for a long time.\n16. Whole-grain crackers\nWhole-grain crackers, specifically rye crackers, are low in fat and packed with fiber. They provide richer nutrients than traditional crackers. The same idea applies to breads, cereals and pastas.\n17. Tabouli\nOne great whole grain to consider adding to your diet is bulgur wheat. It\u2019s often used in an Arabic salad dish called Tabouli. Bulgur wheat is high in fiber and protein but low in fat and calories. It also has a rich, satisfying taste.\n18. Soup\nBroth-based soups can be a very beneficial addition to your diet. We\u2019ve already touched on the benefits of high water content, and soup fits that bill especially well. Also, it\u2019s typically served hot, and, when served before a meal, it can help take up space that would otherwise have been filled with higher-calorie foods.\n19. Salad\nSalad is another great pre-meal filler. Lettuce is high in water content, and salads often are garnished with other healthy vegetables and fruits. Just don\u2019t overdo it on the dressing! Good alternatives to higher-calorie dressings are hummus, salsa, or black bean dip.\n20. Vinegar\nVinaigrette-based dressings are another low-calorie option for salads,\nand they may come with another benefit. Recent studies have shown that vinegar\nmay help the body break down fat.\n21. Nuts.\nNuts are another high-protein snack that can help curb hunger between meals.\nThey\u2019re also high in fiber and heart-healthy fats that can promote weight\nloss and improve cholesterol levels. As with many things, though, the key\nis moderation.\n22. Air-popped popcorn.\nThree cups may seem like a large portion for a snack, but when it\u2019s plain,\nair-popped popcorn, the calorie content is low. The air adds volume for a\nfilling snack with no fat or sugar.\n23. Skim milk.\nMilk does a body good, especially when it\u2019s skim milk. You get the beneficial\ncalcium, protein and vitamin D, without all the fat found in whole milk. Its high\nprotein content means it\u2019s also very filling.\n24. Lean meat.\nA 3- to 4-ounce portion of lean meat is high in fat-fighting\nprotein and burns a lot of calories as it\u2019s digested. However, keep in mind that dark\nmeat is higher in fat, and choose skinless chicken breast, flank steak, eye of round\nor top sirloin beef instead.\n25. Fish.\nFish is one of the best sources of protein. According to research, it\u2019s also\nmore satisfying than chicken or beef. Fish has the added benefit of providing\nomega-3 fatty acids, which help protect against heart disease.\n26. Beans.\nBeans are a power food! They\u2019re a vegetable, a protein and they\u2019re full\nof fiber. All this in a low-calorie, flavorful package that\u2019s easy to prepare.\nAbout Santiam Hospital\nSantiam Hospital & Clinics is a not-for-profit, 40 bed acute-care hospital located in Stayton, Oregon, which is a short 12-mile drive east of Salem, and serves more than 30,000 people annually from the communities of Stayton, Sublimity, Aumsville, Mill City, Jefferson, and the surrounding areas.\nRequest An Appointment\ninfo@santiamhospital.com\n503.769.2175\n1401 North 10th Ave.\nStayton, OR 97383",

However, when you take a closer look and think about this formula, it seems much more complex. What foods should you be eating exactly? Are certain foods better for weight loss than others? Is there such a thing as fat-burning foods?\nThe answer to those questions is yes! And we will soon discuss what foods are best to consume to shed fat and burn calories.\nBut first, we need to address several key points that any weight loss expert will tell you.\nImportant Points About Losing Weight\n\u2022 When decreasing caloric intake, it\u2019ll be natural to experience hunger pains. To prevent this from happening, it\u2019s important to focus on consuming energy-dense foods such as proteins, healthy fats, vegetables, and whole grains!\n\u2022 Consuming fiber-rich meals (I.e meals with many vegetables) will help keep you full for a low-calorie cost.\n\u2022 A high protein diet is key to fat loss. Protein helps keep you full, helps build and preserve muscle tissues, and has a large thermogenic effect. This means it takes a great deal of energy to digest protein (I.e you burn calories eating protein!)\n\u2022 Avoid simple sugars and processed foods. Simple sugars like juices, sodas, chips, and candies can easily add extra calories to your daily intake.\nThey are also digested and absorbed in your stomach very easily - meaning they will not keep you full. Processed foods also lack many essential vitamins and minerals that help contribute to appetite control and energy levels.\nThe 15 best nutrient-dense foods to pack your plate with\n1. Salmon: Salmon is packed with protein, 3oz has 17g protein and is only 177 calories. Salmon is also a rich source of omega 3\u2019s, which helps decrease inflammation in the body. It is also high in many B vitamins, Vitamin D, and Vitamin E.\n2. Bison: Bison is also very high in protein and packed with omega 3 fatty acids. Compared to beef, bison is also leaner and contains more iron. 3oz only has 124 calories!\n3. Eggs: Eggs are considered the highest quality of all the proteins! 2 eggs contain about 150 calories and 12g of protein. They are rich in vitamins A, D, E, B2, B12, and B5.\n4. Edamame: Edamame is top on our list for legumes. 1 cup contains 17g protein and 8g fiber!\n5. Quinoa: Quinoa is a high-quality grain rich in magnesium, calcium, potassium, B-vitamins, Vitamin E, and iron. It is also high in protein. 1 cup contains 8 grams of protein and 5 grams of fiber.\n6. Beets: Beets are full of antioxidants! This vegetable is packed with vitamin C, iron, and potassium. 1 cup is only 60 calories.\n7. Broccoli: Broccoli is full of fiber, packed with nutrients, and is low in calories. 1 cup contains 31 calories and 2.3 grams of fiber.\n8. Artichoke: Artichokes are one of the most fibrous vegetables! 1 medium artichoke contains 7 grams of fiber. They are also packed with vitamin C, K, folate, phosphorous, and magnesium.\n9. Kale: Kale is packed with nutrients! It contains high amounts of vitamins A, K, C, and B6. 1 cup only contains 33 calories and 2.6 grams of fiber.\n10. Berries: Berries are packed with antioxidants. 1 cup of berries contains 85 calories!\n11. Sweet Potato: Sweet potato is loaded with Vitamin A and fiber! 1 medium sweet potato contains 4g fiber and 114 calories.\n12. Pomegranate: Another antioxidant-rich fruit! Pomegranates are loaded with Vitamin C. 1/2 cup of pomegranate seeds is only 72 calories.\n13. Avocados: Avocados are a very rich source of monounsaturated fatty acids, folate, and vitamins C, E, K, and B6. They are also rich in fiber! One avocado contains 10 grams.\n14. Brussels Sprouts: Brussels sprouts are a rich source of vitamin K. 1 cup only contains 38 calories\n15. Green Beans: One cup of green beans only contains 31 calories. They are also rich in fiber and vitamin K.\nSo now that we have an extensive list of some nutrient-dense foods - what would consuming these foods in a day look like?\nSample Meal Plan for Weight Loss Foods\nLet\u2019s build a sample meal plan using these various proteins, grains, vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats to show how easy it is to shed calories while still eating a good amount of food!\n\u2022 Breakfast: 2 eggs, 1/2 avocado, 1 cup berries (364 calories)\n\u2022 AM Snack: 1 cup pomegranate seeds (144 calories)\n\u2022 Lunch: (Kale Salad) 2 cups kale, 3oz salmon, 1/2 cup quinoa, 1/2 cup beets, 1/2 cup broccoli w. balsamic vinegar (604 calories)\n\u2022 PM Snack: 1 cup salted edamame (200 calories)\n\u2022 Dinner: 3oz bison, 1 medium sweet potato w. 1 pat butter, 1 medium artichoke, 1/2 cup green beans (347 calories)\nTotal calories = 1659\nAs you can see, this is still a lot of food for very few calories. Now many of you will need more than this in a day, but this sample demonstrates how much food you can easily consume without increasing caloric intake extensively.\nTo lose weight, you must burn more calories in a day than you eat. Consumption of nutrient-dense foods rich in protein, fiber, and essential vitamins and minerals will all help achieve this goal.\nNo food is superior in \u201cburning fat\u201d, but consumption of a well-balanced healthy diet will prevent any nutrient and energy deficiencies and make it easier to shed unwanted pounds. Lastly, you must choose foods you enjoy eating. You\u2019ll never commit to a meal plan long-term if the foods on your menu don\u2019t satisfy your taste buds.\nRelevant Resources on Weight Loss Foods\nIf this blog interested you, check out the following articles to explore other facets of food and weight loss:",

      "title": "12 Metabolism-Boosting Foods to Aid Weight Loss - UnityPoint Health",
      "content": "12 Metabolism-Boosting Foods to Aid Weight Loss\nWhat Exactly is Metabolism?\nMetabolism is the process the body uses to convert food into the energy needed to survive and function. Metabolism often slows down due to things out of our control, including aging and genetics. However, there are some healthy changes you can make, like eating right and exercising, to help boost your metabolism. The healthier your body is, the better your metabolism may work.\nTry these 12 healthy foods, recommended by UnityPoint Health dietitian Allie Bohlman. Many are rich in protein or fiber , which can make you feel full longer and support weight loss efforts. Remember, metabolism is just one piece of the weight-loss puzzle.\nFoods and Drinks to Naturally Boost Your Metabolism\n1. Fish & Shellfish\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Fish (salmon, tuna, sardines and mackerel) are rich in omega-3 fatty acids and protein. Your body burns slightly more calories digesting protein than fat and carbohydrates.\nTip: The American Heart Association recommends people should eat fatty fish at least two times per week. Don\u2019t like the taste of fish? Take an omega-3 fatty acid (vegetarian-friendly) or fish oil supplement.\n2. Legumes (Also known as beans)\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Legume is a general term used to describe the seeds of plants that are in pods. They include high-protein black bean, chickpeas and kidney beans.\nTip: Add legumes in an easy and affordable way by putting canned beans on your shopping list. If you\u2019re keeping tabs on salt intake, look for the low-sodium labels. Try tossing beans in salads, soup recipes or pasta dishes.\n3. Chili Peppers\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Hot peppers like chili peppers and jalape\u00f1os contain the chemical capsaicin, which gives these vegetables their heat. Capsaicin increases your body\u2019s internal temperature which temporarily helps you burn more calories. Even though this might boost your metabolism, eating more of these won\u2019t significantly help your weight loss.\nTip: Grill, stuff, steam, bake or stir-fry a serving of peppers, or serve them raw to pair with low-fat dips or cottage cheese.\n4. Lean Meats\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Chicken, turkey and other protein-packed lean meats take more energy for your body to break down than carbohydrate or fat-rich foods, therefore, burning slightly more calories during the digestive process.\nTip: Trim off any visible fat from meat and poultry, including the skin. Low-fat cooking methods include broiling, roasting, saut\u00e9ing, grilling and baking.\n5. Low-Fat Milk\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: The calcium and vitamin D found in milk are essential for building dense muscle mass, which is important for overall health.\nTip: Add low-fat milk instead of water to oatmeal, hot cereals and condensed cream soup. Ask for skim or 1% milk when ordering lattes and cappuccinos.\n6. Broccoli\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Broccoli is a member of the cruciferous vegetable family. It's known for its high water and fiber content, which is a great combination to help you feel full.\nTip: Eat broccoli steamed or roasted. Or, enjoy it raw with a low-fat veggie dip.\n7. Lentils\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Lentils are a type of legume and are packed with iron, magnesium and potassium. They are a great plant protein and fiber source with 8 grams of each. Lentils come in a variety of colors including red, brown, green and yellow. All are equally healthy for you.\nTip: Adult women should get more than twice the amount of iron as men. One cup of lentils provides about 35 percent of your daily iron needs.\n8. Oatmeal\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: This is a powerhouse full of fiber that will not only help you last through the morning without hunger but will slow down the release of sugar into your blood stream.\nTip: Start the day with a hot bowl of oatmeal in the morning or make overnight oats the night before in a mason jar for an on-the-go breakfast.\n9. Berries\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Berries, such as blueberries and strawberries, are low in calories and high in fiber. Fiber promotes overall weight loss by reducing your appetite.\nTip: If you can\u2019t find your favorite fresh berries, unsweetened frozen berries are a good substitute during off seasons and are just as nutritious.\n10. Almonds\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Almonds contain lots of healthy fats, fiber and protein, which is a combination that curbs hunger.\nTip: Enjoy a handful of almonds between meals to avoid unhealthy snacks or chop them up for a crunchy salad topper.\n11. Low-Fat Cottage Cheese\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Cottage cheese is low in fat, low in carbs and high in protein, making it ideal for healthy eaters.\nTip: Add a scoop of low-fat cottage cheese to a berry smoothie for a non-traditional twist.\n12. Tempeh\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Tempeh is a great protein substitute for meat if you are looking for a vegetarian option.\nTip: Try using Tempeh in stir-fries, sandwiches, bowls or wraps.\n13. Water\nMetabolism-Boosting Powers: Water can suppress your appetite and maybe boost your metabolism for a short amount of time. Research suggests the more hydrated you are, the better able your body is at just about everything from thinking to making exercise easier.\nTip: Try starting the day off with a glass of water or drink a glass before you eat your meals. To determine how much water to drink per day, divide your weight in half. The number you get should be your liquid amount in ounces.\nDoes Lifting Weights Increase Metabolism?\nBesides these healthy eating tips, one of the best ways to speed up your metabolism is with weight or muscle strengthening. Lean muscle mass increases your metabolism. Muscle is metabolically active, which means people with lean, muscular bodies need more energy to function than people with a higher percentage of body fat. Make sure to talk with your doctor before beginning any new workout routine.\nFind a Doctor\nIncorporating metabolism-boosting foods into your diet is a simple, natural way to support your weight loss journey and improve overall health. From spicy peppers to protein-rich legumes, these nutrient-packed options can give your body the extra push it needs. But remember\u2014sustainable results come from a balanced approach that includes proper nutrition, physical activity and personalized care.\nReady to take the next step?
