      "content": "This is the second in a series of blogs sharing insights from the new book \u201cShifting Paradigms: Growth, Finance, Jobs, and Inequality in the Digital Economy.\u201d\nSince the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, workers like the Luddites in 19th century Britain have feared that they will be replaced by machines and left permanently jobless. To date, these fears have been mostly wrong\u2014but not entirely. In a chapter in \u201cShifting Paradigms,\u201d I examine the implications of automation for jobs and wages.\nAutomation, jobs, and wages\nOn one hand, automation often creates as many jobs as it destroys over time. Workers who can work with machines are more productive than those without them; this reduces both the costs and prices of goods and services, and makes consumers feel richer. As a result, consumers spend more, which leads to the creation of new jobs.\nOn the other hand, there are workers who lose out, particularly those directly displaced by the machines and those who must now compete with them. Indeed, digital automation since the 1980s has added to labor market inequality, as many production and clerical workers saw their jobs disappear or their wages decline. New jobs have been created\u2014including some that pay well for highly educated analytical workers. Others pay much lower wages, such as those in the personal services sector.\nMore broadly, workers who can complement the new automation, and perform tasks beyond the abilities of machines, often enjoy rising compensation. However, workers performing similar tasks, for whom the machines can substitute, are left worse off. In general, automation also shifts compensation from workers to business owners, who enjoy higher profits with less need for labor.\nVery importantly, workers who can gain more education and training, either on the job or elsewhere, can learn new tasks and become more complementary with machines. For instance, while robots have displaced unskilled workers on assembly lines, they have also created new jobs for machinists, advanced welders, and other technicians who maintain the machines or use them to perform new tasks. In general, workers with at least some postsecondary credentials are often made better off, while those without them often suffer losses.\nThe new automation: Is this time different?\nThe \u201cnew automation\u201d of the next few decades\u2014with much more advanced robotics and artificial intelligence (AI)\u2014will widen the range of tasks and jobs that machines can perform, and have the potential to cause much more worker displacement and inequality than older generations of automation. This can potentially affect college graduates and professionals much more than in the past. Indeed, the new automation will eliminate millions of jobs for vehicle drivers and retail workers, as well as those for health care workers, lawyers, accountants, finance specialists, and many other professionals.\nThe new automation will eliminate millions of jobs for vehicle drivers and retail workers, as well as those for health care workers, lawyers, accountants, finance specialists, and many other professionals.\nSo we must ask: Is this time really different? Will the ability of workers to adapt to automation by gaining new education and skills be swamped by the frequency and breadth of tasks that machines with AI will perform?\nAI will increase the challenges many workers will face from automation, while still contributing to higher standards of living due to higher worker productivity. At the same time, we will need a much more robust set of policy responses to make sure that workers can adapt, so that the benefits of automation are broadly shared.\nPolicy implications\nNew and better policies should be adopted in the following areas: education and training, \u201cgood job\u201d creation by employers, and wage supplements for workers.\nOur most important challenge is to improve the breadth and quality of education and training. To become complementary to AI, more workers will need what researchers call 21st century skills. These include communication, complex analytical skills that often require careful judgements of multiple factors, and creativity. The onus is on K-12 and postsecondary schools to adapt and provide greater emphasis on teaching such skills.\nAt the same time, displaced workers and those facing lower compensation will need to retrain to perform new tasks in new or changing jobs. More workers will need reskilling or upskilling\u2014whether on the job or in higher education institutions (both public and private). We need to provide high-quality training in high-demand sectors of the economy, such as health care, advanced manufacturing, and retail logistics, that improves the earnings of less-educated or displaced workers.\nDisadvantaged workers will need more support to complete such education, including occupational guidance and child care. And online learning will have to improve, so it can increase access to skill-building for those who must continue to work full time while training. Indeed, many more employees might need \u201clifelong learning\u201d accounts to pay for such training. As such, policymakers should consider subsidizing employers who retrain workers while taxing those who permanently lay them off in response to automation.\nNew and better policies should be adopted in the following areas: education and training, \u201cgood job\u201d creation by employers, and wage supplements for workers.\nWe must also address two other problems. First, if employers tend to replace many workers and not retrain them, we must make sure that such workers can gain \u201cgood jobs\u201d to replace those lost. \u201cGood jobs\u201d should pay well and offer both advancement possibility and some security. Tax and subsidy policies for \u201cgood job\u201d creation can encourage employers to improve job quality. Mandates on employers can be effective as well, though such mandates must not be so severe and costly that they speed up employer incentives to automate (like a $15 minimum wage might do in low-wage regions of the U.S.).\nSecond, workers might need an enhanced set of supplements to \u201cmake work pay,\u201d such as more generous earned income tax credits, better child care and paid leave, and wage insurance that replaces some part of lost wages for the displaced. These will encourage workers to accept new jobs, though some might pay less than the ones they lose.\nAI and automation will thus create many new challenges for workers, perhaps greater in scope than those created by past automation. But sensible policies can help workers adapt to these changes and share the benefits of the higher productivity that the new technologies will create.\nThe Brookings Institution is committed to quality, independence, and impact.\nWe are supported by a diverse array of funders.

      "title": "What the history of automation can tell us about AI's impact on jobs",
      "content": "There are countless articles making bold statements about how AI will kill job markets. However, in this blog post, I will explore how technological automation has historically impacted economies and consider a range of predictions for our future.\nA brief history of automation\nAutomation is a key part of technology\u2019s evolution and of modern economics. It is particularly pertinent to certain eras, the industrial revolution being a primary example. The mechanization of the factory in the late 18th to early 19th century was a logical shift for owners: they could maintain or increase productivity while lowering operational costs. This understandably led to protest and unrest. In industrial Britain, the Luddites famously destroyed the looms that threatened their livelihoods. And, more recently, General Motors experienced significant discontent after new automation machinery led to layoffs.\nHumans have long been at risk of unemployment brought by technological change. Automation is not the only cause of making humans or even animals redundant \u2014 it\u2019s the constant improvement of tools in general. The greater the efficacy of the tool; the less effort for the user.\nWhile such change has erased some jobs, it has also brought a shift in the kinds of work available, for example, a trend away from manual to intellectual labor. In the UK over the last 50 years, employment in manufacturing has fallen from 25% to about 10% today, whereas the services sector now stands at over 80%.\nThe net-gain economic view\nMany academics argue that there is a net gain over time. There are numerous academic studies on automation and its impact on jobs, particularly within the manufacturing industry. A major study by CEPR (the Centre of Economic Policy Research) refutes the idea that additional robotics lead to job loss. On the contrary, CEPR estimates that each additional robot per 1,000 workers in vehicle production actually increased overall employment by 1.3%. In the popular book Human + Machine: Reimagining Work in the Age of AI, AI is specifically heralded as a technology that will create new jobs if companies invest in it.\nThe net-gain argument states that, like all automation, AI can be an aggregate wealth creator because it creates new opportunities. By delegating tedious tasks to a machine, we give ourselves time to focus on more complex problems, share knowledge and be creative.\nGenerally speaking, this view comes with the caveat that with each advancement in automation technology, there is a short-term loss but a long-term gain.\nThe net-loss economic view\nThis is the hot topic right now. Not necessarily because the outcome is more likely, but because fear gets clicks. While doomsaying might get more attention, it doesn\u2019t mean researchers and thought leaders don\u2019t have a point. An economic study focused on US manufacturing during the \u201890s and \u201800s concluded that each robot replaced 5.6 human workers and reduced wages by 0.5%.\nIn its 2018 Future of Jobs report, The World Economic Forum predicted automation would destroy 75 million jobs but create 133 million over the next four years. The 2020 WEF report concluded that 85 million jobs will be displaced, while 97 million will be created by 2025. In the 2023 Future of Jobs report, 83 million jobs are predicted to be destroyed versus 69 million jobs created, \u201cleading to a contraction of global labor markets by 14 million jobs in the next five years\u201d. This suggests the trend is downward for human employees and upward for robots and algorithms.\nSome predictions prior to the digital revolution claimed that we\u2019d have new and unimaginable jobs in the future, but as Max Tegmark points out in Life 3.0, this prediction was way off. \u201c\u2026 the vast majority of today\u2019s occupations already existed a century ago.\u201d The main trend, Tegmark asserts, isn\u2019t that we\u2019re \u201cmoving to new professions but that we\u2019re crowding into those pieces of terrain \u2026 that haven\u2019t been submerged by the rising tide of technology.\u201d\nThe horse lesson\nThe role of horses in industry has an interesting story to tell. After all, the rate at which work is done in a vehicle is still measured in horse power. Horses were essential to agriculture and travel for millennia. Their role started to diminish during the second agricultural revolution, which is partially attributed to improvements to the plow \u201cso that it could be pulled with fewer oxen or horse\u201d. During the 20th century, their numbers fell from 20 million to 4.5 million in the USA as they were replaced by motor vehicles. The same logic can be applied to people: if a machine can do it better, the human is replaced.\nIf this view is to play out over the coming years, how can a business sell goods or services if there is no one with any disposable income to consume them? One fear is that the wealth gap will widen, with a small percentage in control of vast, automated powerhouses; and then the rest of us. We\u2019ll explore possible solutions later. But first, let\u2019s understand the impact AI is likely to have.\nThe scope of impact\nIt is well documented that AI will impact numerous types of workers: cashiers, paralegal assistants, bakers, bus drivers and construction workers to name just a few from this well-respected academic study by Oxford University. The list is long, and the jobs considered safe (archeology for example) are in relatively low demand. If the stats hold true, we\u2019re set for a complete sociological sea change.\nThe Oxford study claimed there was a high probability that hospitality workers such as waiters, tour guides and bartenders would also be replaced by automation. It may be true that robotics and algorithms will outperform humans in these tasks, but this does not factor-in our visceral desire to interact with other human beings. The front-of-house hospitality staff is part of the authentic experience, and studies have shown that customers value this. Similar research highlights preferences for humans within other customer services.\nIt would be unfair to purely focus on AI\u2019s impact on job retention and creation. In various sectors, automation and AI have proven to be lifesaving. Highly dangerous jobs have been replaced by robots. In many industries, this shift has saved lives. For example, robots can dive autonomously into flooded mines \u2014 deemed too dangerous for human divers \u2014 and use cameras to analyze deposits of increasingly rare and valuable minerals.\nWhile we are right to worry about the job market as a whole, we should not overlook the benefits of automation in lowering the risk to human life and health. This helps us understand why automation is so desirable. It doesn\u2019t just do the dull jobs. It does the dangerous and dirty ones, too.\nLooking at what lies ahead, it can be hard to imagine what the next generation of jobs will be, just as it would have been hard for someone in the 19th century to imagine what our present-day jobs are. In Home Deus, the author Yuval Noah Harari, ponders this. One such example he gives is the virtual world creator, which is a job involving imagination and design skills. However, he argues that even this is not safe because, even in its early stages, AI has proven to be creatively adept. It can write R&B music that garners millions of views. It can even write classical music. And so, it seems there are very few sectors safe from the impact, and its scope can only be limited by major environmental or political factors.\nWhat to do about it\nAt this moment in time, there are four exponential industries \u2014 economic sectors that are changing at an exponential rate: computing, energy, manufacturing and synthetic biology. AI already features in all of them. What happens within these industries and what occurs when they overlap hugely impacts our personal lives, culture and society. What presents an immediate risk is how far behind this exponential change our businesses, governments and laws are, as Azeem Azar has well articulated in his writing. These institutions need to evolve faster to ensure we control the technology and not the opposite. \u201cThat humans have created new systems before should give us some hope,\u201d he concludes.\nIn many sectors, both the technology and the business are already present. In others, this alignment is imminent. The salient theme that emerges from discourse on this topic is about being able \u201c\u201cto manage that displacement.\u201dDoing this would also buy governments crucial time to find ways to close the exponential gap.\nWhat if that fails\nShould there be mass redundancy and aggregate losses, there are various well-documented ideas that might secure our futures, such as universal basic income and a Robotics and AI tax. Both of these approaches have limited case studies, so it\u2019s up to our governments to trial potential solutions and share the results.\nThere\u2019s a whole chapter dedicated to how the Amish adopt new technology in Kevin Kelly\u2019s What Technology Wants. In their society, they carefully consider the impact of a tool before deciding whether to adopt it or not. The economic system many of us live in does not allow for such a mindful and cautious approach. But should we reach a state of joblessness, we\u2019d do well to learn from the Amish culture, where they choose to build houses by hand and, by doing so, give themselves a sense of purpose. We all want to be useful and valued.\nDon\u2019t focus on positives and negatives\nHistorically, there is plenty of evidence to show that jobs have been both destroyed and created by automation. Assuming that the loss trend is only over the medium-term and that there\u2019s a net gain over the long-term, this still presents a problem for the current working population for two reasons:\n- Governments are slow to respond to or anticipate the impact of technological change.\n- Due to financial limitations, family responsibilities and aging, it is difficult to retrain in a new career.\nThis is why it\u2019s so important to make the distinction between job losses and job displacement. Whether you align with the positive or negative economic view of our future, it may be wiser to focus on managing the rate of change than the use of automation itself.",

      "content": "Exploring the Effects of Automation on Employment\nJob seekers have long kept an eye on automation and the effects that it\u2019s had, or will continue to have, on the job market. As technology rapidly advances, it's no surprise that automation continues to be a hot topic across various industries.\nIs there truth to the hype, or is the anxiety and concern merely the product of a phantom fear? Let\u2019s dive into the subject further, unpack the myths, and explore the opportunities automation brings to the workforce.\nWhat Is Automation?\nSimply put, automation involves using technology to perform tasks that typically require human effort. Most often, the tasks replaced by automation are highly repetitive and time consuming. They can range from manufacturing robots and self-checkout kiosks to sophisticated software managing customer services and data entry.\nThe goal? To increase efficiency, reduce errors, and free up human employees to focus on more complex aspects of their jobs.\nThe Myths vs. The Reality\nIt's a common worry that automation might lead to significant job losses as machines or software replace human workers. However, the reality is far more nuanced and, frankly, more optimistic. Automation does indeed change the way work is done and can lead to the displacement of certain types of jobs. But it also creates new opportunities and demands for skills that only humans can provide.\nJob Creation Through Automation\nAutomation has a track record of creating jobs in several ways. For one, as new technologies develop, they require human input for design, maintenance, and oversight. Think about the rise of the IT department in nearly every company over the last few decades\u2014jobs that didn't exist before computers became a workplace staple.\nMoreover, automation can lead to the emergence of entirely new industries. For example, the app development industry exploded with the advent of smartphones, creating roles from software engineering to digital marketing specialists focused on promoting apps.\nSkills and Adaptation\nWith automation taking over routine tasks, there is a growing demand for skills that are uniquely human. Emotional intelligence, creative problem-solving, and interpersonal communication are at a premium in the automated workplace. This shift emphasizes continuous learning and adaptation, encouraging workers to expand their skill sets.\nThe Benefits of Automation\nAside from creating jobs and changing skill demands, automation has several other benefits:\nIncreased Productivity. Automated processes are typically faster and more consistent than manual ones, boosting overall productivity.\nEnhanced Quality of Life. By automating mundane tasks, employees can focus on more engaging and meaningful aspects of their work, potentially increasing job satisfaction.\nEconomic Growth. Increased productivity can lead to lower costs and higher outputs, stimulating economic growth and creating more employment opportunities indirectly.\nNavigating the Transition\nThe transition to a workforce driven by automation can be daunting, but it's also packed with potential. Enterprises can ease this transition by investing in education and training programs to help workers adapt to new roles and new ways of doing old tasks more efficiently.\nRe-skilling initiatives and lifelong learning programs are vital to prepare the workforce for the jobs of tomorrow.\nEmbracing an Automated Future\nAs we explore the effects of automation on employment, it's clear that the future holds much promise. With thoughtful adaptation and proactive learning, we can all look forward to a world where technology and humanity work together to create a brighter, more efficient, and more fulfilling workplace. Let's embrace the change with optimism and excitement for what\u2019s to come!\nPhoto by Possessed Photography on Unsplash",

      "content": "People are worried that AI will take everyone\u2019s jobs. We\u2019ve been here before.\nIn a 1938 article, MIT\u2019s president argued that technical progress didn\u2019t mean fewer jobs. He\u2019s still right.\nMIT Technology Review is celebrating our 125th anniversary with an online series that draws lessons for the future from our past coverage of technology.\nIt was 1938, and the pain of the Great Depression was still very real. Unemployment in the US was around 20%. Everyone was worried about jobs.\nIn 1930, the prominent British economist John Maynard Keynes had warned that we were \u201cbeing afflicted with a new disease\u201d called technological unemployment. Labor-saving advances, he wrote, were \u201coutrunning the pace at which we can find new uses for labour.\u201d There seemed to be examples everywhere. New machinery was transforming factories and farms. Mechanical switching being adopted by the nation\u2019s telephone network was wiping out the need for local phone operators, one of the most common jobs for young American women in the early 20th century.\nWere the impressive technological achievements that were making life easier for many also destroying jobs and wreaking havoc on the economy? To make sense of it all, Karl T. Compton, the president of MIT from 1930 to 1948 and one of the leading scientists of the day, wrote in the December 1938 issue of this publication about the \u201cBogey of Technological Unemployment.\u201d\nHow, began Compton, should we think about the debate over technological unemployment\u2014\u201cthe loss of work due to obsolescence of an industry or use of machines to replace workmen or increase their per capita production\u201d? He then posed this question: \u201cAre machines the genii which spring from Aladdin\u2019s Lamp of Science to supply every need and desire of man, or are they Frankenstein monsters which will destroy man who created them?\u201d Compton signaled that he\u2019d take a more grounded view: \u201cI shall only try to summarize the situation as I see it.\u201d\nHis essay concisely framed the debate over jobs and technical progress in a way that remains relevant, especially given today\u2019s fears over the impact of artificial intelligence. Impressive recent breakthroughs in generative AI, smart robots, and driverless cars are again leading many to worry that advanced technologies will replace human workers and decrease the overall demand for labor. Some leading Silicon Valley techno-optimists even postulate that we\u2019re headed toward a jobless future where everything can be done by AI.\nWhile today\u2019s technologies certainly look very different from those of the 1930s, Compton\u2019s article is a worthwhile reminder that worries over the future of jobs are not new and are best addressed by applying an understanding of economics, rather than conjuring up genies and monsters.\nUneven impacts\nCompton drew a sharp distinction between the consequences of technological progress on \u201cindustry as a whole\u201d and the effects, often painful, on individuals.\nFor \u201cindustry as a whole,\u201d he concluded, \u201ctechnological unemployment is a myth.\u201d That\u2019s because, he argued, technology \"has created so many new industries\u201d and has expanded the market for many items by \u201clowering the cost of production to make a price within reach of large masses of purchasers.\u201d In short, technological advances had created more jobs overall. The argument\u2014and the question of whether it is still true\u2014remains pertinent in the age of AI.\nThen Compton abruptly switched perspectives, acknowledging that for some workers and communities, \u201ctechnological unemployment may be a very serious social problem, as in a town whose mill has had to shut down, or in a craft which has been superseded by a new art.\u201d\nThis analysis reconciled the reality all around\u2014millions without jobs\u2014with the promise of progress and the benefits of innovation. Compton, a physicist, was the first chair of a scientific advisory board formed by Franklin D. Roosevelt, and he began his 1938 essay with a quote from the board\u2019s 1935 report to the president: \u201cThat our national health, prosperity and pleasure largely depend upon science for their maintenance and their future improvement, no informed person would deny.\u201d\nCompton\u2019s assertion that technical progress had produced a net gain in employment wasn\u2019t without controversy. According to a New York Times article written in 1940 by Louis Stark, a leading labor journalist, Compton \u201cclashed\u201d with Roosevelt after the president told Congress, \u201cWe have not yet found a way to employ the surplus of our labor which the efficiency of our industrial processes has created.\u201d\nAs Stark explained, the issue was whether \u201ctechnological progress, by increasing the efficiency of our industrial processes, take[s] jobs away faster than it creates them.\u201d Stark reported recently gathered data on the strong productivity gains from new machines and production processes in various sectors, including the cigar, rubber, and textile industries. In theory, as Compton argued, that meant more goods at a lower price, and\u2014again in theory\u2014more demand for these cheaper products, leading to more jobs. But as Stark explained, the worry was: How quickly would the increased productivity lead to those lower prices and greater demand?\nAs Stark put it, even those who agreed that jobs will come back in \u201cthe long run\u201d were concerned that \u201cdisplaced wage-earners must eat and care for their families \u2018in the short run.\u2019\u201d\nWorld War II soon meant there was no shortage of employment opportunities. But the job worries continued. In fact, while it has waxed and waned over the decades depending on the health of the economy, anxiety over technological unemployment has never gone away.\nAutomation and AI\nLessons for our current AI era can be drawn not just from the 1930s but also from the early 1960s. Unemployment was high. Some leading thinkers of the time claimed that automation and rapid productivity growth would outpace the demand for labor. In 1962, MIT Technology Review sought to debunk the panic with an essay by Robert Solow, an MIT economist who received the 1987 Nobel Prize for explaining the role of technology in economic growth and who died late last year at the age of 99.\nIn his piece, titled \u201cProblems That Don\u2019t Worry Me,\u201d Solow scoffed at the idea that automation was leading to mass unemployment. Productivity growth between 1947 and 1960, he noted, had been around 3% a year. \u201cThat\u2019s nothing to be sneezed at, but neither does it amount to a revolution,\u201d he wrote. No great productivity boom meant there was no evidence of a second Industrial Revolution that \"threatens catastrophic unemployment.\u201d But, like Compton, Solow also acknowledged a different type of problem with the rapid technological changes: \u201ccertain specific kinds of labor \u2026 may become obsolete and command a suddenly lower price in the market \u2026 and the human cost can be very great.\u201d\nThese days, the panic is over artificial intelligence and other advanced digital technologies. Like the 1930s and the early 1960s, the early 2010s were a time of high unemployment, in this case because the economy was struggling to recover from the 2007\u2013\u201909 financial crisis. It was also a time of impressive new technologies. Smartphones were suddenly everywhere. Social media was taking off. There were glimpses of driverless cars and breakthroughs in AI. Could those advances be related to the lackluster demand for labor? Could they portend a jobless future?\nAgain, the debate played out in the pages of MIT Technology Review. In a story I wrote titled \u201cHow Technology Is Destroying Jobs,\u201d economist Erik Brynjolfsson and his colleague Andrew McAfee argued that technological change was eliminating jobs faster than it was creating them. This wasn\u2019t just about a mill shutting down. Rather, advanced digital technologies were leading to job losses across a broad swath of the economy, raising the specter once again of technological unemployment.\nIt\u2019s difficult to pinpoint a single cause for something as complex as a dip in total employment\u2014it could be just a result of sluggish economic growth. But it was becoming increasingly obvious, both in the data and in everyday observations, that new technologies were changing the types of jobs in demand\u2014and while that was nothing new, the scope of the transition was troubling, and so was the speed at which it was happening. Industrial robots had killed off many well-paying manufacturing jobs in places like the Rust Belt, and now AI and other digital technologies were coming after clerical and office jobs\u2014and even, it was feared, truck driving.\nIn his farewell speech before leaving office in January 2017, President Barack Obama spoke about \u201cthe relentless pace of automation that makes a lot of good middle-class jobs obsolete.\u201d By that time, it was clear that Compton\u2019s optimism needed to be rethought. Technical progress was not turning out to lead to inevitable job growth, and the pain was not limited to a few specific locations and industries.\nWhy Musk is wrong\nIn an interview late last year with the UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, Elon Musk declared there will come a time when \u201cno job is needed,\u201d thanks to an AI \u201cmagic genie that can do everything you want.\u201d Musk added that as a result, \u201cwe won\u2019t have universal basic income, we\u2019ll have universal high income\u201d\u2014apparently answering Compton\u2019s rhetorical question about whether machines will be \u201cthe genii which \u2026 supply every need and desire of man.\u201d\nIt might not be possible to prove Musk wrong, since he gave no timeline for his utopian prediction; in any case, how do you argue against the power of a magical genie? But the end-of-work meme is a distraction as we figure out the best way to use AI to expand the economy and create new jobs.\nBreakthroughs in generative AI, such as ChatGPT and other large language models, will likely transform the economy and labor markets. But there\u2019s no convincing evidence that we\u2019re on a path to a jobless future. To paraphrase Solow, we should worry about that when there\u2019s a problem to worry about.\nEven a bullish estimate about the effects of generative AI by Goldman Sachs puts its impact on productivity growth at around 1.5% a year over the next 10 years. That, as Solow might say, is nothing to sneeze at, but it\u2019s not going to end the need for workers. The Goldman Sachs report calculated that roughly two-thirds of US jobs are \u201cexposed to some degree of automation by AI.\u201d Yet this conclusion is often misinterpreted\u2014it doesn\u2019t mean all those jobs will be replaced. Rather, as the Goldman Sachs report notes, most of these positions are \u201conly partially exposed to automation.\u201d For many of these workers, AI will become part of the workday and won\u2019t necessarily lead to layoffs.\nOne critical wild card is how many new jobs will be created by AI even as existing ones disappear. Estimating such job creation is notoriously difficult. But MIT\u2019s David Autor and his collaborators recently calculated that 60% of employment in 2018 was in types of jobs that didn\u2019t exist before 1940. One reason innovation has created so many new jobs is that it has increased the productivity of workers, augmenting their capabilities and expanding their potential to do new tasks. The bad news: this job creation is countered by the labor-destroying impact of automation when it\u2019s used to simply replace workers. As Autor and his coauthors conclude, one of the key questions now is whether \u201cautomation is accelerating relative to augmentation, as many researchers and policymakers fear.\u201d\nIn recent decades, companies have often used AI and advanced automation to slash jobs and cut costs. There\u2019s no economic rule that innovation will in fact favor augmentation and job creation over this type of automation. But we have a choice going forward: we can use technology to simply replace workers, or we can use it to expand their skills and capabilities, leading to economic growth and new jobs.\nOne of the lasting strengths of Compton\u2019s 1938 essay was his argument that companies needed to take responsibility for limiting the pain of any technological transition. His suggestions included \u201cco\u00f6peration between industries of a community to synchronize layoffs in one company with new employment in another.\u201d That might sound outdated in today\u2019s global economy. But the underlying sentiment remains relevant: \u201cThe fundamental criterion for good management in this matter, as in every other, is that the predominant motive must not be quick profits but best ultimate service of the public.\u201d\nAt a time when AI companies are gaining unprecedented power and wealth, they also need to take greater responsibility for how the technology is affecting workers. Conjuring up a magical genie to explain an inevitable jobless future doesn\u2019t cut it. We can choose how AI will define the future of work.\nKeep Reading\nMost Popular\nWe\u2019re learning more about what vitamin D does to our bodies\nThe sunshine vitamin could affect your immune system and heart health.\nHow AGI became the most consequential conspiracy theory of our time\nThe idea that machines will be as smart as\u2014or smarter than\u2014humans has hijacked an entire industry.

      "content": "Evaluating the Impact of AI on the Labor Market: Current State of Affairs\nKey Takeaways\n-\nWhile the occupational mix is changing more quickly than it has in the past, it is not a large difference and predates the widespread introduction of AI in the workforce.\n-\nCurrently, measures of exposure, automation, and augmentation show no sign of being related to changes in employment or unemployment.\n-\nBetter data is needed to fully understand the impact of AI on the labor market.\n-\nWe plan on updating this analysis regularly moving forward to see how the impact of AI on the labor market changes over time.\nAuthors\nMartha Gimbel, Executive Director of the Budget Lab\nMolly Kinder, Senior Fellow \u2013 Brookings Metro\nJoshua Kendall, Research Fellow at the Budget Lab\nMaddie Lee, Research Assistant at the Budget Lab\nHow has AI impacted the labor market? Since generative AI was first introduced nearly three years ago, surveys show widespread public anxiety about AI\u2019s potential for job losses. While it is impossible to accurately predict the future, we can examine how U.S. employment has changed since ChatGPT\u2019s release in November 2022.\nOur analysis complements other recent studies that provide nascent evidence of possible AI impacts on specific occupations and sub-populations, such as early career workers. We took a broader lens, widening the aperture to the whole labor market, and asked two main questions.\nFirst, is the pace of labor market change in this 33-month period of employment disruption different from past periods of early technological change? Second, is there evidence of economy-wide employment effects? To answer these questions, we compare how quickly the occupational mix has changed across a range of measures since ChatGPT\u2019s launch, and compare this to past disruptions from computers and the internet.\nOverall, our metrics indicate that the broader labor market has not experienced a discernible disruption since ChatGPT\u2019s release 33 months ago, undercutting fears that AI automation is currently eroding the demand for cognitive labor across the economy.1\nWhile this finding may contradict the most alarming headlines, it is not surprising given past precedents. Historically, widespread technological disruption in workplaces tends to occur over decades, rather than months or years. Computers didn\u2019t become commonplace in offices until nearly a decade after their release to the public, and it took even longer for them to transform office workflows. Even if new AI technologies will go on to impact the labor market as much, or more, dramatically, it is reasonable to expect that widespread effects will take longer than 33 months to materialize.\nOf course, our analysis is not predictive of the future. We plan to continue monitoring these trends monthly to assess how AI\u2019s job impacts might change. It is important to remember that the effects of new technologies are evolving and a simple snapshot in time is not enough to explicitly determine what the future holds.\nIs this Time Different? Changes in the Occupational Mix\nThe current rhetoric about AI mirrors the anxiety over earlier generations of technological progress. So far, is this time different?\nFirst, we look at how quickly the overall occupational mix changed in the first 33 months since ChatGPT\u2019s relative to previous periods of technological change. Figure 1 compares the occupational mix by month to the mix in a baseline period at the start of a major technological development (e.g. January 1996 is the baseline month for the growing adoption of the internet). The job mix for AI appears to be changing faster than it has in the past, although not markedly so. (See the appendix for a discussion of pre-trends.)\nThe occupational mix refers to the distribution of workers amongst all the jobs in the economy. In this context, a percentage point difference means that, relative to the start point, that percent of workers are in new occupations. This can occur by workers changing jobs, losing jobs, or unemployed people getting a new job. As such, this metric attempts to capture how different the sum of occupations that make up the labor force is relative to another point in time. By measuring this over the time generative AI has been publicly available, we can test the claim that AI is substantially changing the workforce by any of the methods mentioned above (pushing workers from one job to another, automating workers out of a job, or creating new jobs). Note that a change over this time period simply reflects change \u2014 it does not take a stance on the cause of that change. Note that if recent grads are not getting hired, that would show up in this measure in as much as recent grads (as discussed below) are often in different occupations than older workers.\nWith the development of the internet and the growing prevalence of computers, the turn of the 21st century gave rise to concerns over an imminent computerization of many jobs. Despite this automation anxiety, the occupational mix by 2002 was at most around 7 percentage points different than it was in 1996; i.e., only 7 percent of workers in 2002 would need to switch occupations to match the composition of the 1996 labor market.\nChanges in the occupational mix since the advent of generative AI in 2022 seem to mirror the trends seen during the three comparison periods. The recent changes appear to be on a path only about 1 percentage point higher than it was at the turn of the 21st century with the adoption of the internet. Although recent trends seemingly outpace historical shifts in the occupational mix, the potential effects of AI on the labor market so far are not out of the ordinary. In fact, taking a closer look at recent years, the data suggests that this recent trend is not necessarily attributable to AI (Figure 2). Shifts in the occupational mix were well on their way during 2021, before the release of generative AI, and more recent changes do not seem any more pronounced, even as the use of AI continues to grow in popularity.\nRepeating this analysis by industry similarly suggests a limited effect of AI. Figure 3 reports the change in the occupational mix from November 2022 within different industries. The Information, Financial Activities, and Professional and Business Services sectors have all seen larger shifts in the job mix compared to the shifts in the aggregate labor market, with the largest changes in the Information sector. (As a reminder the information sector includes things like newspapers, movies, and data processing.) These industries are among those with the highest exposure to generative AI. Although at first glance these changes may seem attributable to generative AI, the data again suggests that the trends within these industries started before the release of ChatGPT (Figures 4-6). In fact, over a broader time horizon, the large shifts in the Information Industry seem to be a feature of the industry itself rather than a consequence of any one technological development (Figure 7).\nLooking over an even longer horizon, labor market volatility appears rather low. As a chart Jed Kolko shows, the change in the occupational mix seen in Figure 1 is sluggish compared to the change seen in the 40s and 50s (which reflected mass labor market changes due to world events). Kolko cautioned that \u201cwe simply don\u2019t know for sure whether automation, algorithms, and AI will ultimately create more jobs than they destroy.\u201d\nThe dissimilarity data we have examined indicates that there is no substantial acceleration in the rate of change in the composition of the labor market since the introduction of ChatGPT. Lacking that, there is nothing meaningful we can either attribute or misattribute to AI.\nRecent College Graduates\nFigure 9 compares the occupational mix for recent college graduates (ages 20-24) to that of their older counterparts (ages 25-34).2 If generative AI were in fact substantially changing the labor market for recent college graduates, we would expect to see a growing dissimilarity in the occupational mix between these two groups. The dissimilarity has increased slightly faster in recent months than it did in a previous time period, which could be consistent with a recent paper from Brynjolfsson et al. showing a possible impact of AI on employment of early career workers. It could also simply reflect a slowing labor market. However, our results should be interpreted with caution particularly given small sample sizes.\nTaking a closer look at the trend since January 2021, the dissimilarity between older and more recent college graduates rarely deviates outside of the 30-33% range (Figure 10). This implies that these trends of growing dissimilarity may pre-date ChatGPT\u2019s release and may not be attributable to AI. However, there is perhaps some slight upward momentum more recently, though this is consistent with both Brynjolfsson et al.\u2019s work and the CPS\u2019s noisiness (and a slowing labor market hitting younger workers). Further, the same caution in interpretation given the small sample sizes holds in this figure as well.\nInsights from AI \"Exposure\" and Usage\nTo better understand whether AI is impacting the labor market, we would want to analyze whether the share of workers in occupations that are most impacted by AI usage is changing over time. If AI were automating jobs at scale, we would expect to see a smaller share of workers in some of the jobs that are most negatively impacted.\nUnfortunately, comprehensive usage data is not publicly available. The best available data we have is from OpenAI and Anthropic, respectively, that detail the occupations that are most \u201cexposed\u201d to genAI tools (a theoretical, forward-looking metric across all jobs) and that have the highest actual usage of one specific AI tool, Claude (a more narrow, present-focused metric). While imperfect, these data are our best approximation of AI job \u201crisk\u201d. (See discussion of limitations in the next section and in the appendix.)\nImportantly, OpenAI and Anthropic are measuring different things and we look at them separately.\nOpenAI's \"Exposure\" Data\nWe use data from OpenAI that shows a measure of \u201cexposure\u201d to ChatGPT technology. This refers, generally, to whether utilizing ChatGPT4 technology can help reduce the time it takes to complete the occupation\u2019s tasks by at least 50%. (The data appendix describes this metric in more detail.)\nWe utilize the \u201cBeta\u201d exposure metric, which also accounts for if a model with additional software built on top of it can help reduce task completion time, though this capability is weighted half that of \u201cdirect\u201d exposure. An exposure score is created on a scale from 0 to 1 based on a percent of an occupation\u2019s tasks that are \u201cexposed\u201d to genAI. The data appendix describes this metric in more detail.\nFor our purposes, we categorize occupations into three groups using their exposure score quintile; an occupation has the lowest degree of exposure if it falls in the first two quintiles, a medium degree if in the 3rd and 4th quintiles, and the highest degree if in the top quintile. In other words, these metrics look at relative not absolute exposure. We provide a further discussion of this in the appendix.\nWe ask: has the share of workers in occupational exposure quintiles changed since ChatGPT\u2019s launch? Our analysis shows that it has not (Figure 11). The share of workers in the lowest, middle, and highest occupational exposure groups stay stable at around 29%, 46% and 18%, respectively.\nEven when specifically examining the unemployed population, there is no clear growth in exposure to generative AI. Figure 12 depicts the average percentage of tasks exposed amongst unemployed workers by duration of unemployment. AI-driven displacement might suggest a growth in the proportion of exposed tasks amongst recently unemployed workers. Irrespective of the duration of unemployment, however, unemployed workers were in occupations where about 25 to 35 percent of tasks, on average, could be performed by generative AI. Although there is some variation between months, the data demonstrate no clear upward trend and no clear difference by the duration of unemployment.\nAnthropic's Usage Measure\nGiven Anthropic\u2019s usage data\u2019s novelty and uniqueness, there is no established standard for how to aggregate it. The usage Anthropic observes does not contain every single task in the O*NET task database, so the question of how to handle the missing tasks remains ambiguous. We proceed in two ways:\nFirst, we ignore tasks that are not included in the Anthropic data and aggregate following the method detailed in the appendix. This method makes no assumption about how workers are using or could utilize Claude to perform the task, or how workers in occupations with tasks like those observed would use Claude. However, this method significantly limits the number of tasks and therefore occupations we can include. Further, an occupation may appear to have very high usage while in fact only a single of that occupation\u2019s tasks were observed in the data.\nAlternatively, we include all of the missing tasks and assume their usage is zero. There is some truth to this, as those tasks were not observed in Claude during the period in which the data was collected. However, it makes strong assumptions about those tasks\u2019 potential usage. Two comparable tasks, where one appears in the data and one does not, would have totally different usage values. Given how the observed Claude data is a representation of the users who happened to utilize the model over a sample period, the following period could have had that similar task included.\nIn pursuit of a balanced and well-informed exploration of this data, we include results from both methods below.\nAnthropic\u2019s data on AI usage shows similar trends of stability over time, rather than disruption. The proportion of employment in occupations with high levels of task AI usage, whether automation or augmentation (as defined as more than half of AI usage), is stable at around 70% or 11%, respectively (Figure 15). When assuming that unobserved tasks indicate zero usage, however, these proportions drop to 3% and 0%, respectively. Repeating a similar analysis as above, Figures 16 and 18 report the occupation-level share of tasks that are automation or augmentation, respectively, amongst unemployed workers by duration of unemployment. Note: for this analysis, we use Anthropic\u2019s most recent data on AI usage, which was released in mid-September. We discuss Anthropic\u2019s data vintages more fully in the Appendix.\nData Limitations \u2014 and Why Better Data is Needed\nAs previously noted, the metrics from OpenAI and Anthropic are imperfect proxies for AI risk and usage, while still being the best available.\nA key limitation of OpenAI\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d data is that it is not based on actual usage, and should therefore be interpreted as a theoretical estimate of the jobs and sectors that could, in theory, be impacted. In reality, actual AI usage and workplace diffusion has varied dramatically between sectors and occupations with similar levels of \u201cexposure.\u201d For instance, generative AI tools were adopted extremely quickly and at mass scale among coders and software developers, who are in the top quintile of exposure. Meanwhile, adoption has lagged considerably in clerical sectors, despite a similar level of exposure. Thus analyzing occupations by exposure alone likely under-estimates potential labor market disruption, as the top quintiles of exposure will include occupations that are theoretically exposed but not actively using AI at a meaningful scale, and thus unlikely to see AI impacts.\nA comparison of the OpenAI \u201cexposure\u201d data with the Anthropic usage data makes this limitation clear. The two measures appear to have only a limited correlation with one another (Figure 20).\nFigure 20 consists of occupations that have data for both the OpenAI and Anthropic measures, which amounts to about 80% of CPS occupations in our sample. Figure 21 splits the data from figure 20 into quadrants along the axes of low-high exposure and low-high usage and then groups the data into its SOC job categories. Particularly striking is the greater range of different job categories in the quadrants with low usage (the left side of figure 20) and conversely the concentration in just a handful of categories in the high usage quadrants. Across both high and low exposure, high usage occupations are dominated by scientific and quantitative professions and general business occupations. The occupations clustered in the low usage/exposure (bottom left of figure 20) tend to be production occupations with little computerization.\nJust as the OpenAI metric has limitations, so too does Anthropic\u2019s usage data. Figure 22 shows the occupational shares of all \u201cconversations\u201d with Claude (the AI chatbot), and illustrates the occupation groups that are over- and under- represented in this usage, compared to their exposure ranking and employment share.\nIt is clear from the data that Claude\u2019s usage is heavily dominated by one occupational group \u2014 computer and mathematical, which includes coders \u2014 and that arts and media (including writers) is also considerably overrepresented. While certainly coding is among the most prominent use cases of AI, it is likely that Claude\u2019s userbase skews more heavily to these tasks due to Claude\u2019s stand-out reputation among LLMs as being particularly good at writing and coding. New data recently published by OpenAI shows a broad pattern of usage among ChatGPT customers across a range of industries, including not only information services (including software development) but also professional services and even manufacturing. It is entirely possible, and even likely, that usage data from other AI models like Google\u2019s Gemini or Microsoft\u2019s Copilot would show different and more varied patterns of usage. Thus data from Claude usage alone is not representative of how workers across the economy are using AI chatbots and tools.\nTo accurately measure AI\u2019s impact on the labor force, the most important data needed is comprehensive usage data from all the leading AI companies at the individual and enterprise level, including APIs. Anthropic has led the way in transparently sharing Claude usage data, including a new release of enterprise data. To further our understanding of AI\u2019s impact, it is important that all leading AI labs do the same in a similarly transparent and privacy-protected way.\nSummary\nWhile anxiety over the effects of AI on today\u2019s labor market is widespread, our data suggests it remains largely speculative. The picture of AI\u2019s impact on the labor market that emerges from our data is one that largely reflects stability, not major disruption at an economy-wide level. While generative AI looks likely to join the ranks of transformative, general purpose technologies, it is too soon to tell how disruptive the technology will be to jobs. The lack of widespread impacts at this early stage is not unlike the pace of change with previous periods of technological disruption. Preregistering areas where we would expect to see the impact and continuing to monitor monthly impacts will help us distinguish rumor from fact.\nAppendix\nCode used to create the data can be found here.\nWe adapt Duncan and Duncan\u2019s methodology to construct a dissimilarity index of the change in the occupational mix over time using monthly CPS data. Going month by month, we measure each occupation\u2019s constituent percentage of the workforce and compare it to the starting month. To address noise in the data, we take a 12 month moving average for each month. We then sum up the absolute differences in percentage of workforce across all occupations to get our dissimilarity index for that given month. This captures both the advent of new occupations and the expansion or contraction of existing ones.\nTo examine generative AI\u2019s impact, we begin in November 2022 and continue into the latest monthly CPS release in July, as this lines up with AI\u2019s public introduction and the beginning of its adoption. We compare AI\u2019s dissimilarity index to three other time periods:\n- 1984-1989: Capturing the popularization of PCs and the start of the computer revolution.\n- 1996-2002: Capturing mass adoption of the internet in public life and the workplace.\n- 2016-2019: A control period following the 2008 Recession recovery during which there was little change to the occupational mix.\nFigure A1 adds pre-trends in the occupational mix for the prior 12 months to the data from Figure 1. In all but one period, the pre-trends show a similar degree of dissimilarity as compared to the trend observed over the first year. This lack of a substantial difference suggests the advent of new technologies has minimal immediate effects; i.e., shifts in the labor market take time to develop. Note that the large pre-trends in the \u201cComputers\u201d period are likely due to issues with the quality of data prior to 1981.\nUsing OpenAI\u2019s occupational exposure data, we classify occupations as mildly, moderately, or highly exposed to AI provided that generative AI can reduce the time to complete at least one task (or a greater portion of tasks given the exposure level) by 50%. The raw occupational exposure data allocates tasks into one of three categories:\n- No exposure: Generative AI cannot reduce the time to complete the task or lowers the quality of the output.\n- Direct exposure: Generative AI can reduce the time to complete a task by at least 50%.\n- LLM+ Exposed: Generative AI alone cannot reduce task completion time, but a piece of software built on top of a model could.\nWe utilize the GPT4 categorized \u201cBeta\u201d exposure, which gives a task a score of 1 if it is directly exposed, or a score of .5 if it is LLM+ Exposed. An occupation\u2019s exposure is the weighted average of the exposure of each individual task.\nFollowing the methods in OpenAI\u2019s paper presenting these results, when aggregating exposure to the occupational level, a job\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d tasks have a weight of 1 while their \u201csupplemental\u201d tasks have a weight of .5. After exposure and usage are aggregated to the SOC code level, they are weighted by that occupation\u2019s OES labor count. This weight is used when aggregating from SOC code to CPS code.\nGiven the exposure data was created a few years and thus does not include the more advanced capabilities of today\u2019s large language models, a relative comparison of exposure appears more appropriate. Rather than measuring the now aged direct exposure, we broke GPT4 Beta exposure (after our aggregation and weighting) into quintiles and bucketed them as described in the text above. The average exposure, rounded to the second digit, for each quintile is as follows:\nFigure A2 replicates the prior analysis in Figure 12 with occupation-level exposure groups instead defined using the absolute measure of exposure. The lowest and medium exposure groups (scores less than 0.4 and between 0.4 and 0.8, respectively) stably comprise around 45% of workers each, while the highest exposure group represents only around 2% of workers (scores greater than 0.8). Like in Figure 12, there is no observable trend over time.\nAnthropic\u2019s usage metrics are aggregated similarly to the OpenAI exposure data. We follow the method their researchers use here. We aggregate the individual kinds of usage into their respective categories for each task:\n- Augmentation = Validation + Task Iteration + Learning\n- Automation = Directive + Feedback Loop.\nWe then weight the tasks using the same core/supplemental weighting method described above. Following that, the aggregation to CPS code level is identical to the OpenAI aggregation.\nThroughout this piece we use Anthropic\u2019s AI usage data from their most recent release in August. This data, however, only provides a static snapshot of AI usage. As more data is made available in future releases, the Budget Lab will continue to update this analysis to provide a more comprehensive picture of how changes in AI usage may be affecting the labor market. Figure A3 shows the trend in the automation/augmentation of tasks using data from a prior March release until August 2025 (note that to ensure consistency between the two releases, the August usage data excludes enterprise usage).\nFootnotes\n- Much of the press focuses on early career and white collar workers being in lower demand.\n- In any given year, recent and older college graduates account for around 1,100 and 5,600 observations (3% and 12% of the overall sample), respectively.",

      "content": "Summary\nEmployees may not always initially embrace job automation. In this article, we share the benefits.\nRead time: 4 minutes\nAs workflows become increasingly automated, some people are worried about how it may affect job security.\nAccording to the latest World Economic Forum report\u00b9, automation and robots will replace some seven million jobs in the next five years. An Oxford University study\u00b2 found that 47 percent of U.S. jobs are \u201chighly automatable.\u201d\nThe news sounds scary. But people who skim over these headlines are missing the big picture. While some jobs will indeed be lost, others will be created, and many more will involve less tedium and more creativity. In the long run, job automation will expand the economy, even though the occupations themselves will be different from the ones we have today.\nMore time for strategic thinking \u2014 and customers\nWhile processes will become increasingly digitized, very few of those jobs will be entirely automated, at least not in the near or medium term, a recent McKinsey report\u00b3 found. Instead, workers will devote less time \u2014 or no time \u2014 to repetitious drudge work, and more time to high-level strategy and dealing with customers. This especially impacts small to midsize businesses whose owners and managers are being pulled in numerous directions at once, making it easy to either neglect backend processes, or conversely, spend far too much time on them.\nYou can see it happening already in areas such as finance, where modernized accounts payable processes free workers to concentrate on solving high-level problems \u2014 or listen to customers and learn what new services they would like, leading to possible new lines of business (and probably, new automated workflows).\nIn fact, job automation will reduce errors and increase productivity tremendously. It will become an important competitive differentiator, the McKinsey report said.\nJobs that can be fully automated have a higher chance of disappearing. You likely won\u2019t be seeing as many want ads for assembly line workers, call center employees, or data entry clerks. Meanwhile, insurance underwriters and tax preparers who deal with the basics will need to learn new skills.\nArtificial intelligence and machine learning\nIn addition, as artificial intelligence and machine learning become more sophisticated, higher-level jobs will also be affected, but not eliminated. This process has already begun.\nIn law, for example, e-discovery algorithms have been used for years to find documents relevant to cases, saving millions of dollars. The software is accurate, too \u2014 it finds 95 percent of relevant documents, compared to just 51 percent for humans.\nSo you might think that paralegals, who used to do this work, would go the way of the dinosaur. On the contrary, the occupation has grown faster than the labor force as a whole, increasing by over 50,000 since the late 1990s. Firms that save money on document search can use it to expand, and there\u2019s still plenty of work for paralegals to do.\nIT is another example. With so many functions moving to the cloud and fewer servers to manage, it can be easy to immediately question the need for an onsite IT team. Yet in 2015, IT employment rose in every occupation and industry except oil and gas, with an overall increase of 3.1 percent, or 152,000 jobs\u2074.\nIT workers may not be splicing wires and measuring disk space anymore, but they are managing cybersecurity, streaming services, and internet of things (IoT) applications. They still have to support office machines and make sure systems integrate smoothly. And, somebody has to manage all those relationships with cloud vendors and make sure their programs are tied to existing systems without conflict. As small business owners know, this can often be their responsibility \u2014 whether they are comfortable or educated in the subject matter or not.\nIn the end\nHistory has taught us that workers will learn new skills required by the changing markets and the evolving technologies. It\u2019s also taught us companies will adapt their processes and people to these innovations. But although job automation can perform many tasks that are good for, and needed by small businesses, they can\u2019t replace the human creativity and people skills that ultimately nurture the relationship with your prospects and customers.\nAutomate your workflows\nAre your data capture and workflow processes sufficient?\nExplore ways to automate workflowsRecommended for you\nCapilano University\nFind out how Ricoh built a feature-rich document management solution for Capilano University's Registrar's Office to help improve daily workflow and save both time and money.\nHow technology is improving employee job training\nNew tech tools are turning learning on the job into something different than our traditional notions of learning.\nDigital Workplace: Definition & Complete Guide\nImplement a digital workplace that gives your business the scalability and flexibility you need to stay competitive.

      "content": "Assessing the Real Impact of Automation on Jobs\nMIT economist David Autor argues that focusing on exposure alone misses the nuances of how experts and nonexperts experience task shifts.\nWho\u2019s more at risk of being replaced by automation: a crossing guard or an air traffic controller? Both prevent collisions, but only one requires years of specialized training. An air traffic controller could do a crossing guard\u2019s job \u2013 but not the other way around. And while the guard\u2019s work is untouched by automation, the controller\u2019s tools are increasingly automated to reduce human error.\nThe answer, says MIT economist David Autor, is nuanced. In a talk hosted by the Stanford Digital Economy Lab at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered AI, Autor challenged the assumption that automation exposure simply means job loss. \u201cExposure is not a very useful term,\u201d Autor said. \u201cIs it the case that if you\u2019re exposed, you\u2019re hosed?\u201d\nNot necessarily, he said. He pointed to Uber: Wages for taxi drivers stagnated, but employment rose 249% from 2000 to 2020 as automation lowered the barrier to entry. In contrast, proofreaders saw wages rise but job numbers decline as automation removed simpler tasks while adding expert tasks that made the role more specialized.\n\u201cProofreading used to mean spell-checking. Now it\u2019s about helping people write,\u201d Autor said.\nIn short, Autor found that automation both replaces and augments expertise \u2013 it depends on whether rote tasks are removed and expert ones added, and how specialized a role becomes as a result.\nAn Objective Model to Track Automation\u2019s Impact\nTo evaluate the impact of automation on occupations, Autor tracked the addition and removal of tasks in job descriptions from 1977 to 2018, alongside shifts in wages and employment. To determine what constituted an expert versus an inexpert job, Autor drew from Zipf\u2019s law and the efficient coding hypothesis. These concepts explain how language evolves to include common shortcut words in order to streamline communication. Initially, these jargon words are understood by a select few experts, but they enter the common vernacular over time.\n\u201cI will be able to say \u2018LLM\u2019 or \u2018GPT\u2019 or whatever, and you\u2019ll all know what I mean,\u201d Autor said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have known what I meant five years ago, but you know what I mean now.\u201d\nAutor used this idea to distinguish between common \u2013 or nonexpert \u2013 words and less frequent \u2013 or expert \u2013 words as he evaluated job descriptions between 1977 and 2018.\nImpact of Exposure Depends on Expert Supply\nAutor found that for jobs that gained inexpert tasks but lost expertise, wages declined as technology made it possible for more people to do more of the tasks required \u2013 like in the Uber scenario. Knowing the most highly trafficked places to pick up passengers and the right routes to get them to their destinations were no longer expert tasks \u2013 more people could do the job. Taxi driving became less specialized.\nAutor\u2019s model found that the opposite trends occurred \u2013 employment went down and wages rose \u2013 for jobs that lost inexpert tasks but gained expert tasks that upgraded their expertise levels. In the proofreader example, inexpert tasks like \u201cplaces proof and copy side by side on reading board\u201d went away, but \u201cconsult reference books to check references with rules of grammar and composition\u201d were added.\n\u201cExpertise is much closer to a supply change,\u201d he added. \u201cWhen expertise falls, it\u2019s a reduction in barriers. When expertise requirements rise, it\u2019s an increase in barriers.\u201d\nPredicting a Job\u2019s Future by Assessing Routine Tasks\nAutor used a large language model to classify tasks into three categories: abstract tasks that require creativity, reasoning, and interpersonal skills; routine tasks that follow clear, repetitive rules; and manual tasks that involve physical effort and common sense but little formal training. He found that 64.5% of removed tasks in his data set were routine, while 75.6% of added tasks were abstract. In other words, jobs with many routine tasks in 1977 had far fewer routine tasks by 2018.\nWhat does that imply for a job\u2019s expertise level? In some occupations, losing routine tasks led to lower wages. In others, it increased specialization and pay.\n\u201cFor some things you\u2019re taking away the supporting activities. You\u2019re allowing people to specialize and focus on their comparative advantage,\u201d Autor said. \u201cFor other sets of occupations, you\u2019re taking away their primary activity, and so you\u2019re removing what\u2019s special about that occupation and reducing it down to the generic activities that many more people could do,\u201d he said.\nAutor noted that these results show the \u201cexposure paradox\u201d in action. \u201cThese are exposed occupations, but the exposure has completely different meanings for how that work is going to change,\u201d he said.\nDoes Automation Replace Experts or Augment Expertise? The Answer Is \u201cYes.\u201d\nReturning to his study\u2019s central question, Autor said automation both replaces experts and augments expertise. It depends on whether abstract or routine tasks are removed and added and whether expertise continues to be in demand for a given role.\nHe emphasized that focusing only on exposure misses the point. What matters is the one-way fungibility of expertise: Experts can do nonexpert work when displaced, but not the reverse. The key question is whether expertise can transfer \u2013 or whether it becomes stranded in an increasingly routine domain.\nAI\u2019s Impact Is an Open Question\nAutor acknowledged that his framework can\u2019t fully predict AI\u2019s effects, since his data ends in 2018 \u2013 before tools like ChatGPT launched broadly to the public. And because it\u2019s still unclear which tasks AI will eliminate or enhance, the long-term impact on expertise is unknown.\nStill, he noted that AI could help nonexperts access skills they previously lacked. Paralegals and nurse practitioners, for example, could gain from lower barriers to expertise, he said.\n\u201cIn the good scenario, AI enables more people to do more expert tasks,\u201d Autor said. \u201cNow that\u2019s not good for experts, but it\u2019s good for a lot of other people.\u201d\nWatch the full Digital Economy Lab seminar with David Autor.",

      "content": "Credit: Shutterstock / Marish\nA new study measures the actual impact of robots on jobs. It\u2019s significant.\nMachines replacing humans in the workplace has been a perpetual concern since the Industrial Revolution, and an increasing topic of discussion with the rise of automation in the last few decades. But so far hype has outweighed information about how automation \u2014 particularly robots, which do not need humans to operate \u2014 actually affects employment and wages.\nThe recently published paper, \u201cRobots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labor Markets,\" by MIT professor and Boston University professor Pascual Restrepo, PhD \u201916, finds that industrial robots do have a negative impact on workers.\nThe researchers found that for every robot added per 1,000 workers in the U.S., wages decline by 0.42% and the employment-to-population ratio goes down by 0.2 percentage points \u2014 to date, this means the loss of about 400,000 jobs. The impact is more sizable within the areas where robots are deployed: adding one more robot in a commuting zone (geographic areas used for economic analysis) reduces employment by six workers in that area.\nTo conduct their research, the economists created a model in which robots and workers compete for the production of certain tasks.\nIndustries are adopting robots to various degrees, and effects vary in different parts of the country and among different groups \u2014 the automotive industry has adopted robots more than other sectors, and workers who are lower and middle income, perform manual labor, and live in the Rust Belt and Texas are among those most likely to have their work affected by robots.\n\u201cIt\u2019s obviously a very important issue given all of the anxiety and excitement about robots,\u201d Acemoglu said. \u201cOur evidence shows that robots increase productivity. They are very important for continued growth and for firms, but at the same time they destroy jobs and they reduce labor demand. Those effects of robots also need to be taken into account.\u201d\n\u201cThat doesn't mean we should be opposed to robots, but it does imply that a more holistic understanding of what their effects are needs to be part of the discussion \u2026 automation technologies generally don't bring shared prosperity by themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cThey need to be combined with other technological changes that create jobs.\u201d\nIndustrial robots are automatically controlled, reprogrammable, multipurpose machines that can do a variety of things like welding, painting, and packaging. They are fully autonomous and don\u2019t need humans to operate them. Industrial robots grew fourfold in the U.S. between 1993 and 2007, Acemoglu and Restrepo write, to a rate of one robot per thousand workers. Europe is slightly ahead of the U.S. in industrial robot adoption; the rate there grew to 1.6 robots per thousand workers during that time span.\nImprovements in technology adversely affect wages and employment through the displacement effect, in which robots or other automation complete tasks formerly done by workers. Technology also has more positive productivity effects by making tasks easier to complete or creating new jobs and tasks for workers. The researchers said automation technologies always create both displacement and productivity effects, but robots create a stronger displacement effect.\nAcemoglu and Restrepo looked at robot use in 19 industries, as well as census and American Community Survey data for 722 commuting zones, finding a negative relationship between a commuting zone\u2019s exposure to robots and its post-1990 labor market outcomes.\nAdding one robot to a geographic area reduces employment in that area by six workers.\nBetween 1990 and 2007, the increase in robots (about one per thousand workers) reduced the average employment-to-population ratio in a zone by 0.39 percentage points, and average wages by 0.77%, compared to commuting zones with no exposure to robots, they found. This implies that adding one robot to an area reduces employment in that area by about six workers.\nBut what happens in one geographic area affects the economy as a whole, and robots in one area can create positive spillovers. These benefits for the rest of the economy include reducing the prices of goods and creating shared capital income gains. Including this spillover, one robot per thousand workers has slightly less of an impact on the population as a whole, leading to an overall 0.2 percentage point reduction in the employment-to-population ratio, and reducing wages by 0.42%. Thus, adding one robot reduces employment nationwide by 3.3 workers.\nIn a separate study of robot adoption in France, Acemoglu and his co-authors found that French manufacturing firms that added robots became more productive and profitable, but that increases in robot use led to a decline in employment industrywide.\nDisproportionate impacts\nThe impact of robots varies among different industries, geographic areas, and population groups. Unsurprisingly, the effect of robots is concentrated in manufacturing. The automotive industry has adopted robots more than any other industry, the researchers write, employing 38% of existing robots with adoption of up to 7.5 robots per thousand workers.\nThe electronics industry employs 15% of robots, while plastics and chemicals employ 10%. Employees in these industries saw the most negative effects, and researchers also estimate negative effects for workers in construction and retail, as well as personal services.\nWhile the automotive industry adopted robots at a quicker pace and to a greater degree than other sectors, that industry did not drive the study\u2019s results. The impact of robots was consistent when that industry was taken out of the equation, the researchers write.\nAI Executive Academy\nIn person at MIT Sloan\nRegister Now\nRobots are most likely to affect routine manual occupations and lower and middle class workers, and particularly blue-collar workers, including machinists, assemblers, material handlers, and welders, Acemoglu and Restrepo write. Both men and women are affected by adoption of robots, though men slightly more. For men, impacts are seen most in manufacturing jobs. For women, the impacts were seen most in non-manufacturing jobs.\nRobots negatively affect workers at all education levels, though workers without college degrees were impacted far more than those with a college degree or more. The researchers also found robot adoption does not have a positive effect on workers with master\u2019s or advanced degrees, which could indicate that unlike other technology, industrial robots are not directly complementing high-skill workers.\nSome parts of the United States saw relatively small adoption of robots, while in other states, including Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Texas, and Virginia, robots have been adopted more along the order of two to five robots per thousand workers. In some parts of Texas, that number goes up to five to 10 per thousand workers, the researchers found. Detroit was the commuting zone with the highest exposure to robots.\nOverall, robots have a mixed effect: replacing jobs that relatively high-wage manufacturing employees used to perform, while also making firms more efficient and more productive, Acemoglu said. Some areas are most affected by the mixed impact of robots. \u201cIn the U.S., especially in the industrial heartland, we find that the displacement effect is large,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen those jobs disappear, those workers go and take other jobs from lower wage workers. It has a negative effect, and demand goes down for some of the retail jobs and other service jobs.\u201d\nAcemoglu and Restrepo emphasize that looking at the future effect of robots includes a great deal of uncertainty, and it is possible the impact on employment and wages could change when robots become more widespread. Industries adopting more robots over the last few decades could have experienced other factors, like declining demand or international competition, and commuting zones could be affected by other negative shocks.\nRelated Articles\nBut the researchers said their paper is the first step in exploring the implications of automation, which will become increasingly widespread. There are relatively few robots in the U.S. economy today and the economic impacts could be just beginning.\nRobotic technology is expected to keep expanding, with an aggressive scenario predicting that robots will quadruple worldwide by 2025. This would mean 5.25 more robots per thousand workers in the U.S., and by the researchers\u2019 estimate, a 1 percentage point lower employment-to-population ratio, and 2% lower wage growth between 2015 and 2025. In a more conservative scenario, the stock of robots could increase slightly less than threefold, leading to a 0.6 percentage point decline in the employment-to-population ratio and 1% lower wage growth.\nThe economic crisis spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic will further exacerbate the good and bad impacts of robots and technology, Acemoglu said. \u201cThe good because we are really dependent on digital technologies. If we didn't have these advanced digital technologies, we wouldn't be able to use Zoom or other things for teaching and teleconferencing. We would not be able to keep factories going in many areas because workers haven't fully gotten back to work,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the same time, by the same token, this increases the demand for automation. If the automation process was going too far or had some negative effects, as we find, then those are going to get multiplied as well. So we need to take those into account.\u201d\nRead \"Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labor Markets\"",
