      "content": "Best cricket players in the world 2024\nOur round-up of the best cricket players in the world right now.\nThere is so much to consider when evaluating the best cricketers in the world. How does a five-wicket Test haul compare with an IPL-winning 70? How much value is placed in being an all-format cricketer?\nCompiling these rankings meant balancing form with track record. We don\u2019t want to succumb to recency bias, but if we're looking at the best cricketers right now, there had to be a weighting to performances over the last 12 months.\nAll-rounders seemingly have an advantage. If you can influence the game in multiple ways, that surely puts you ahead of a specialist batter or bowler. Yet there is still huge value in the best players in their discipline, whether that's a T20 finisher with the willow in hand or a new-ball genius in Test cricket.\nStatistics are more accessible than ever, but a list of this nature will always be subjective and there are going to be players left out that many fans would want included.\nRadioTimes.com brings you our ranking of the 10 best cricketers in the world at the moment.\nBest cricketers in the world 2024\n10. Shakib Al Hasan\nThe ICC rankings aren't everything. Shakib Al Hasan ranking in the top three among all-rounders in Tests, ODIs and T20Is is significant, though, particularly for a player who has maintained this standard over such a long period.\nHis batting average is higher than his bowling average in all three formats. Shakib might be into his mid-thirties, and his career hasn't been short of controversy, but he remains one of the best players in the world.\n9. Kagiso Rabada\nKagiso Rabada made his international debut back in 2014. Since then, he has established himself as an incredibly effective, all-format, fast bowler. Rabada's control, pace and bounce make him an asset even on unhelpful surfaces.\nHe averages just 22 with the ball in Test cricket, and has become a fixture on the franchise T20 circuit. Boasting the best Test match strike rate of bowlers to play more than 18 Tests, Rabada has flourished as the leader of the South African attack after the retirements of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel.\n8. Pat Cummins\nThe last 12 months couldn't have gone much better for Pat Cummins. After retaining the Ashes and winning the World Test Championship, Cummins skippered Australia to World Cup glory, which included an exceptional bowling performance in the final.\nNamed the ICC Men's Cricketer of the Year for 2023, Cummins then became the second-most expensive IPL player ever at the 2024 auction. His diverse skillset with the ball is paired with useful lower-order batting, and there are signs he's improving as a captain.\n7. Daryl Mitchell\nDaryl Mitchell might have arrived late to international cricket, but he's wasted no time making a major impact. Averaging over 50 with the bat in both Tests and ODIs, the New Zealander has also picked up several franchise gigs, including a big-money deal with the Chennai Super Kings for the 2024 season.\nMitchell has constructed lengthy Test knocks and provided explosive white-ball cameos. He's among the most versatile batters in the world at the moment, and is one of the first names on the Black Caps' team sheet in all formats.\n6. Joe Root\nEngland's greatest ever batter had to find a place in these rankings even after a lean spell. Joe Root is third in the Test batting rankings, and remains an excellent white-ball player.\nHis majestic 122 not out in Ranchi was arguably his greatest innings of all, which is saying something for a player with 47 international centuries and an average just shy of 50 in both Tests and ODIs. With 11,626 Test runs to his name, and still only 33 years old, Root could catch Sachin Tendulkar for the most Test runs of all time.\n5. Yashasvi Jaiswal\nYashasvi Jaiswal has taken international cricket by storm. His pair of double centuries against England have accounted for numerous records. It's not just the runs, though, but the manner in which he has scored them.\nJaiswal has attacked the new ball, he's dug in when required, and he's shown all the flair that\u2019s made him an accomplished short-format player. At just 22 years of age, the sky really is the limit. Owner of the fastest 50 in IPL history, Jaiswal is going to be an all-format superstar.\n4. Heinrich Klaasen\nPlacing a batter with minimal Test experience this high up might be controversial. Heinrich Klaasen has played just four Tests at the time of writing, but his extraordinary white ball hitting means he has to be considered among the world\u2019s best players.\nThe South African has the second-highest strike rate in IPL history. Of the top 13 players by career ODI strike rate, Klaasen is the only one to average 40 with the bat. Capable of destroying any bowling attack, the Pretoria native has become a sought-after player on the T20 circuit thanks to his ability to hit boundaries in the middle overs and finish off innings with big hitting.\n3. Rachin Ravindra\nLike Jaiswal, Rachin Ravindra has quickly grabbed the headlines. Excellent in the World Cup and impressing with the bat and ball in the Test series against South Africa, Ravindra is a key player for the Black Caps across all three formats.\nThe numbers are yet to paint a full picture of just how good Ravindra is. Only turning 25 later this year, the best is still to come, and don't be surprised if we see some more statement performances from the all-rounder.\n2. Jasprit Bumrah\nJasprit Bumrah is the best bowler in the world. There is no debate at this point \u2013 Bumrah is the man you want with the ball in his hand whether it's the first over of a Test or the last of a white-ball final.\nHis short run and unique, jerky action make it difficult for batters to pick him up. Awkward angles are created. He can swing and seam the red ball when conditions allow, plus he has a nasty bouncer, which is paired with some unplayable yorkers.\n1. Ravindra Jadeja\nTop of the Test all-rounder rankings by a mile, Ravindra Jadeja is a complete cricketer. Not only an accomplished batter across all three formats, Jadeja is an excellent spinner, capable of attacking in the subcontinent and playing a holding role overseas.\nThat's before we've even mentioned his fielding, where he's arguably the best in the world.\nLike so many all-rounders, his averages do not fully reflect his impact on the game, though averaging 12 more with the bat than the ball in Tests is an indication of his greatness.\nSometimes his bowling is in the shadow of Ravichandran Ashwin, and he's never going to be the batting star alongside Virat Kohli and others. Jadeja is a fierce competitor, though, and would be in contention for a world XI in any conditions in any format.\nWant to see this content?\nWe're not able to show you this content from Google reCAPTCHA.

      "content": "ICC Men's Player Rankings\nThe International Cricket Council player rankings is a widely followed system of rankings for international cricketers based on their recent performances.\nThe ratings were developed at the suggestion of Ted Dexter in 1987.[1] The intention was to produce a better indication of players' current standing in the sport than is provided by comparing their averages. Career averages are based on a player's entire career and do not make any allowance for match conditions or the strength of the opposition, whereas the ratings are weighted towards recent form and account for match conditions and the quality of the opponent using statistical algorithms.[2]\nInitially the rankings were for Test cricket only, but separate One Day International rankings were introduced in 1998. Both sets of rankings have now been calculated back to the start of those forms of the game. The rankings include the top 10 Test, ODI and T20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of each player.\nRankings calculations\n[edit]The player rankings are a weighted average of all a player's performances, with recent matches weighted most heavily (so the overall effect of a good or bad performance decline over time). Each match performance is given a rating out of 1000, based on a set of pre-determined criteria, and these figures averaged.[3] This means that the maximum possible overall rating is 1000, and a player gaining a rating of 900 is seen as an exceptional achievement.[4] Separate lists are maintained for batting and bowling and an all-rounder rating is also published, which is obtained by multiplying a player's batting and bowling rating together and dividing by 1000.\nFor batting, the performance rating is based on a combination of runs scored, the rating of the opposition bowlers, match result and comparison to the overall scores in the match. A bowler gains points based on wickets taken, runs conceded and match result, with more points gained for dismissing highly rated batsmen. A damping-factor is applied to a player's rating at the start of their career, so they do not get a full rating for their performances until they have played about 20 Tests.\nTest rankings\n[edit]Top 10 Test batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 Test bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 Test all-rounders\n[edit]ODI rankings\n[edit]Top 10 ODI batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 ODI bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 ODI all-rounders\n[edit]T20I rankings\n[edit]Top 10 T20I batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 T20I bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 T20I all-rounders\n[edit]Historical rankings\n[edit]Historical Test cricket rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in Test cricket\n[edit]Batting and Bowling and All-rounders with a peak rating of 900 points or more\n[edit]- All-rounders with a peak rating of 500 points or more[7]\nHistorical One Day International (ODI) cricket rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in ODI cricket\n[edit]Top 10 rankings: batting and bowling with a peak rating of 850 points or more\n[edit]- Top 10 Rankings All-rounder[10]\nHistorical T20I rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in T20I cricket\n[edit]Top 10 T20I rankings: batting and bowling with a peak rating of 750 points or more\n[edit]- Top 10 Rankings Batting[11]\n- Top 10 Rankings Bowling[12]\n- Top 10 Rankings All-rounder[13]\nSee also\n[edit]- ICC Men's Test Team Rankings\n- ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings\n- ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings\n- International cricket\n- ICC Women's Player Rankings\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Eastaway, Rob. \"How the World Cricket Rankings were born\".\n- ^ \"About ICC Cricket Rankings\".
