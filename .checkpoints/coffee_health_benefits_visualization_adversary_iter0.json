      "title": "Boost Your Brain Function with Coffee: The Science Behind It",
      "content": "Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages, consumed by millions of people every day. It's not just a delicious drink that provides an energy boost, but it can also have a positive impact on your brain function. Many studies have shown that coffee can improve memory, concentration, and overall cognitive performance.\nWhether you're a student looking to study for an exam or a professional trying to stay focused at work, coffee may be just what you need to enhance your mental capabilities. In this article, we'll explore the science behind coffee's effects on the brain and uncover the benefits of incorporating it into your daily routine.\nThe Good Stuff - Performance\n-\nOne scoop will infuse your coffee with healthy ingredients\n-\nDitch the bad stuff like sugar, dairy, and artificial creamers\n-\nFights inflammation and supports skin and joint health\n-\nMakes your coffee taste great\nCoffee Can Improve Cognitive Function\nCaffeine stimulates the central nervous system (CNS). It does this by interacting with the receptors that send out adenosine.\nAdenosine is the neurotransmitter in your brain that makes you sleepy. This neurotransmitter generally builds up over the course of a day and makes you sleepy by the end of it by lowering neural activity.\nCaffeine has a very similar molecular structure to adenosine, but it doesn't slow down your neural activity. Instead, it increases this activity so you can feel energized. When you ingest caffeine, it binds to the receptors that adenosine would otherwise bind to.\nStudies examining this suggest that you'll feel stimulated instead of sleepy. Routine coffee drinkers tend to back this up with their own experience!\nCaffeine also increases something called \"resting brain entropy.\" This is what lets your brain function understand and process information around you.\nWhen you increase your resting brain entropy, you'll have an easier time processing information. This includes visual, auditory, and tactile information. It also includes what people say to you and short-term recollections of things you learn.\nBetter Concentration\nIt's no secret that those who are sleepy have poor concentration. Research shows that even those who have only one bad night's sleep will have impaired focus. They'll also have trouble ignoring other distractions while at home or at work.\nReplacing adenosine helps you feel less sleepy so you can focus better. Caffeine also triggers your brain into producing and releasing dopamine, which makes you more alert.\nHigher Energy Levels\nYour bloodstream absorbs any caffeine that you consume through your gastrointestinal tract. This tract connects to your circulation and allows it into your blood flow. Once the caffeine is in your blood, your body carries it throughout your entire body as well as your brain.\nTufts University researchers find that your blood's caffeine concentration will peak within 15 minutes and 2 hours. This will give the person a boost of energy that will be at its highest during the peak period of 2-12 hours.\nThis may make you:\n- Become more excited about learning new things\n- Make you more physically active\n- Make you more interested in the tasks you must complete\n- Stimulate learning processes so you can work faster\n- Boost your mind to stay alert, focused, and task-oriented\nPart of this is because caffeine block specific receptors in the region of your brain linked with multiple types of learning. This is why you get a boost. It all comes down to brain chemistry!\nLess Mental Fatigue\nMental fatigue is somewhat different than physical exhaustion. Your body can remain alert and awake while your mind is exhausted.\nBrain fog can be debilitating to those who have to work or be social. It also can be really irritating and frustrating to feel out of control of your own thoughts and behaviors.\nCoffee can work wonders when it comes to nipping mental fatigue in the bud. Some research suggests that drinking just 100 milligrams of caffeine will stop the worst of mental fatigue from slowing you down. Caffeinated coffee drinkers also found that they have fewer headaches than those who were given decaffeinated coffee or a placebo.\nA daily cup of coffee can keep your brain power on at full blast throughout the day. You'll feel great and be more ready to tackle your everyday tasks.\nQuicker Reaction Times\nA University of Waterloo study examined whether caffeine could improve people's visual skills. Participants were asked to detect moving targets and their locations.\nThe researchers concluded that those who had consumed caffeine (such as in coffee) could detect the targets more quickly than those who had not had caffeine. They also found that participants' reaction times increased. They responded to their environments faster.\nThis is important because people are constantly surrounded by movements that impact their everyday lives. Spotting pedestrians at crosswalks, maneuvering your cart through a retail store, and interacting with walking strangers all require responsiveness.\nCaffeine can help you get through your day more quickly. It can help you be more present at any given time. You'll be able to better navigate your fast-paced surroundings.\nCoffee Can Improve Your Mood (as Well as Your Brain Power)\nCoffee stimulates a neurotransmitter called dopamine. Dopamine is sometimes called the 'feel-good neurotransmitter' because it gives you pleasant feelings of happiness, contentment, and even euphoria. This is the primary reason your morning cup of coffee immediately makes you feel amazing.\nCoffee also has antioxidant properties and can prevent inflammation. This will make you feel fresher and more alert, and the energy boost will naturally make you more active. An active mind has more to do, makes you more productive, and lets you do exciting and rewarding things.\nAccording to European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) studies, adults who drink coffee frequently throughout the day will be in better moods. Their research concluded that the prime amount of coffee was about 75mg (2/3 of a cup) every 4 hours.\nShort-Term Mood Boosts: What Do They Look Like?\nThe mood boosts associated with coffee have several different short-term benefits. Some of the most important include:\n- Heightened interest in daily activities\n- Feeling less overwhelmed by work and everyday tasks\n- More energy and productivity\n- Lower levels of irritability (so you can foster better connections)\n- Better self-image\nThese are all signs that your mental health is improving, and coffee can be a great catalyst for this process.\nMood boosts also have a tangible impact on workplace productivity. About 28% of survey respondents say that coffee makes them more efficient at work. Workers are also about 13% more productive when they're happy, which is likely related to the mood boost from caffeine.\nStudies also show that drinking coffee 60-90 minutes after you wake up ensures that you get both the cortisol needed to wake naturally and the caffeine boost that can increase your alertness even more.\nDecreasing the Risk of Depression\nIn addition to boosting mood in the short term, studies suggest that caffeine may decrease the risk of clinical depression in the long term. One 2011 study found that the risk of depression decreases over time for women who regularly consume caffeinated coffee.\nIt did this by measuring 50,739 clinically healthy women over 10 years, some of whom drank coffee and some of whom did not. 2607 developed depression during this timeframe. Those who drank coffee developed fewer depressive symptoms over time than those who did.\nLeading neurology researchers at Harvard University quantified this. Their findings showed that those who drink coffee are about 1/3 less likely to develop depression than those who do not.\nSo, in addition to short-term mood boosts, you'll also have the long-term benefit of decreasing depression risk.\nHow Much Coffee Will Give You a Boost?\nCoffee is best when you drink it in moderation.\nIf you consume any stimulant in excess, it could prove unsafe. Too much coffee will increase your heart rate so much that you become restless and shaky. You will also likely have insomnia and headaches if you overuse coffee.\nLuckily, experts say these symptoms only usually come if you drink 5+ cups of coffee in a short timeframe. A cup every few hours isn't going to create these problems. Just parse out your consumption throughout the day.\nGenerally, 2 cups of coffee are the minimum you'll need to drink for a noticeable mood boost. According to one Korean study, 2 cups can decrease self-reported depression by about 32%. People report that they are less sad and down when they have coffee.\nThose who have 2-5 cups of coffee daily will gain all these benefits without compromising their mental and physical well-being.\nYou'll Get a Memory Boost With Your Daily Cup of Coffee\nCoffee can help you improve your memory in several different ways. According to Oxford researchers, caffeine gives you more serotonin and a brain chemical called acetylcholine. These chemicals make you happy and carry messages to nerves throughout your body.\nThe mood boost of serotonin stimulates the brain. While stimulated, the brain will transmit strong messages throughout the body, especially your bloodstream. This helps to build a stronger connection between your brain and blood and stabilizes this barrier.\nHowever, caffeine isn't the only memory-boosting coffee ingredient. A cup of coffee also contains polyphenols, which are micronutrients that also naturally occur in fruits and veggies. They're antioxidants that combat stress and stress-related tissue damage.\nPolyphenols, Memory, and Stroke Risk\nMany studies suggest that polyphenols may prevent tissue damage due to free radicals. They might also stop the blood vessels in your brain from being blocked.\nIn these ways, researchers believe that this coffee ingredient could combat the risk of strokes. This is further backed up by Korean studies that cite coffee consumption as a factor that may proactively protect against strokes in middle-aged women.\nFinally, trigonelline- a natural substance in coffee beans- can increase antioxidants inside your system. This is yet another way to protect your blood vessels and stop inflammation.\nFree blood flow to and from the brain opens pathways that will improve your cognition and memory. You'll have an easier time recalling information and activities later.\nShort-Term Coffee Benefits for Memory\nThese chemicals mean that coffee (and caffeinated energy bites) boosts your short-term memory. In addition to being more aware and alert, you'll have a sharper recollection of events that transpired since you drank the coffee.\nMemory is, however, complex. If you drank some coffee during the encoding and retrieval processes, your brain will store it longer than it would without the coffee.\nYou'll need to drink caffeine during the appropriate part of the memory process if you want to feel the full impact. Luckily, that's easy because you'll be given multiple things to recall even while drinking a single cup.\nSo, you'll remember events and information for a few extra days when you lean on caffeine!\nThe study that found these results also tested those who drank coffee once vs. those who drank it multiple times. Multiple-time users recalled more pairs of words they were given to remember previously than those who only had one cup.\nYou'll probably have a steadily good memory if you're a regular coffee drinker and have a daily cup of coffee. If you use it once, you'll get some benefits, though not the full effect. It's a good idea to make a cup of joe more routine than a one-off.\nA Long-Term Memory Enhancer\nA 2021 study also examined the impacts of caffeine on long-term memory. As we previously discussed, they found that it greatly boosted cognitive function.\nWhen information is presented passively, it's easy for people to forget it in the short term. Coffee enables you to learn passively-presented tasks and remember how to perform them. This is true in addition to boosting information recall.\nRemembering these tasks can make long-term learning easier. You'll be able to develop skills more quickly and use them throughout your life.\nThe study also found that caffeine may improve how well people perform tasks. If someone does not drink coffee, they may struggle to utilize their working memory to complete given tasks. However, those who drink coffee regularly will have more access to working memory and complete tasks more accurately and efficiently.\nIced coffee will also give you these same benefits in the summer heat. Memory enhancement isn't seasonal!\nPrevention of Alzheimer's and Dementia\nWith the memory-enhancing cognitive effects of caffeine, it should come as no surprise that it may prevent long-term memory loss disabilities like Alzheimer's. 2015 researchers explored the impacts of the psychoactive stimulant on elderly populations at risk for dementia.\nCross-sectional studies and longitudinal population-based data suggested that coffee may act as a protective barrier against the onset of these conditions. While this is not always true, the link is too strong to ignore.\nAnother study quantified this information more precisely.\nWhile other studies may not be completely consistent in their results, a CAIDE study of information found that 3 in every 5 researchers found that coffee stopped cognitive decline to some degree. They looked at consumption habits and saw that drinking 3-5 cups of coffee daily in midlife decreased the risk of Alzheimer's by about 65%.\nWhile experts are still tackling the link between cognitive disabilities in later life and coffee, the connection looks pretty strong.\nCoffee Changes Your Brain Structure\nA single cup of coffee will give you more brain power in the short term. However, it won't alter your brain chemistry or structure in the long term. On the other hand, regular coffee drinkers will see overarching changes to their brain's structure that can benefit them.\nUniversity of Basel researchers in Switzerland studied caffeine's impact on brain gray matter. \"Gray matter\" is a type of brain tissue that connects your brain to your spinal cord. It has high concentrations of neuronal bodies, nerve endings, and dendrites that make your central nervous system function properly.\nTwenty people (all regular coffee drinkers) were given tablets to take over the course of two 10-day stretches. Ten were given caffeinated pills, while the other ten were given a placebo.\nThey all got brain scans after the study. Researchers saw from these scans that those who had caffeinated pills had less gray matter in their brains than those who had a placebo tablet. This was extremely obvious in the area of the brain that consolidates memory.\nThese changes to the brain structure were temporary. The regular coffee drinkers at the beginning of the study gained excess gray matter from that coffee after ten days without caffeine. Still, this is an interesting comparison that shows how huge of an impact coffee can have.\nThis is the core takeaway from the study. The leading researcher, Dr. Carolin Reichert, noted that less gray matter does not mean that caffeine has a negative impact on the brain. All it shows is that coffee impacts our cognitive hardware, which is something that we should research further.\nAnd, given the impact of the other studies we've talked about, these changes are likely a good thing.\nThe Medical Impacts of Functional Brain Changes\nA 2021 study found that shifts in brain chemistry stemming from coffee can improve motor control. Researchers used fMRI technology to examine the brain's limbic resting and somatosensory states. They examined both regular coffee drinkers and those who didn't drink much caffeine.\nCoffee drinkers had reduced connectivity in these brain areas. This means that they would have higher motor control than their coffee-free counterparts.\nThe researchers also discovered that there is more dynamic activity in some regions of the brain for those who drink coffee. They had more activity in multiple subcortical and cerebellar areas. This is correlated with the ability to focus as well as motor control.\nYour Brain's Neural Network\nAnother scientific study assessed 21 adults with electroencephalography (EEG). EEG uses electrodes to measure electrical activity in the brain. Since brain cells communicate with neurons and with the body via electrical impulses, EEG lets researchers see differences in brain structure and function.\nThe researchers believed that coffee was making the brain's neural connections stronger. They looked at the brain half an hour before coffee consumption and half an hour after. They then graphed out the differences in electrical activity and performed correlation analyses on their data.\nIn the end, the study suggested that coffee may have beneficial effects on executive function in the long term. Brain scans showed more efficient neural networks after coffee consumption, especially when compared to baseline function. Coffee drinkers had a different, more efficient brain structure than those who did not drink caffeine.\nResearchers also performed cognitive tests on participants before and after coffee consumption. Those who drank coffee performed better on both tests, and this improvement correlated with the brain scans' changes.\nCoffee makes your brain faster at processing information, more cohesive, and better able to send commands to the body and receive sensory data. Your internal cognitive network will be more interconnected when you consume it regularly.\nImprove Your Brain Function With Coffee Today\nCoffee is more than just a delicious morning drink. It's also a great way to give your cognitive health a boost. Now that you know how your daily cup of coffee can improve brain function, memory, mood, and more, it's time to get started.\nFor Wellness is committed to providing you with delicious coffee that gives your brain a daily boost.",

      "content": "Coffee is one of the world\u2019s favorite and most popular beverages, the third most popular beverage after water and tea. For many people, it is an indispensable habit before going to work and a socialization tool for the rest of the day. In general, the average consumption varies from 2 to 6 cups per day. What are the health implications? Given this consumption, the benefits are actually greater than the risks. This is the conclusion of a careful study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (van Dam et al., 2020).\nThe beneficial pharmacological effects of coffee, as demonstrated by numerous scientific studies, are related to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, anticancer, chemoprotective and hepatoprotective properties (Doepker et al., 2022; Ruggiero et al., 2022). Coffee contains more than a thousand compounds, many of which have yet to be discovered. Several phytochemicals have been described as coffee components, including alkaloids (caffeine, trigonelline, adenine-7-glucosyl, theobromine, and 7-methylxanthine), flavonoids (anthocyanins, quercetin glucoside, quercetin, isoquercitrine, rutin, and kaempferol), terpenoids (kahweol, cafestol, and 16-O-methyl cafestol), amino acids (histidine and pipecolic acid), sucrose, tannins, xanthonoids (mangiferin and isomangiferin), phenolic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids), and catechins (catechin and epicatechin).\nMany authors have studied the effects of caffeine and its major constituents in clinical and cellular experiments (Doepker et al., 2022; Ruggiero et al., 2022; Teramoto et al., 2023). However, the published results are controversial regarding its effects on different types of pathologies. Moderate coffee consumption in good health, with the exception of some phases of a woman\u2019s life (pregnancy and lactation), can have beneficial effects, significantly reducing various chronic diseases. A recent study reports that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of head and neck cancer; in this regard, meta-analyses consistently report a beneficial relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality, concluding that approximately 6% of years of healthy life lost would be prevented if all consumers drank three cups of coffee per day (Doepker et al., 2022).\nCoffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing chronic liver disease (Kolb et al., 2020). The beneficial effect would be independent of the type of coffee: it is good whether it is instant, ground or decaffeinated and is associated with a reduced risk of chronic liver disease, including hepatitis (Kennedy et al., 2021). In addition, there are studies reporting that increased coffee consumption is associated with lower circulating hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels and reduces the development of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular cancer (Kakiyama et al., 2022).\nIt is reported that regular and moderate consumption of coffee can reduce the risk of death and the risk of death from cardiovascular causes. In fact, a study conducted by Simon et al. (2022), focuses that regular coffee consumption plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease. From the results of this analysis, which included 468,629 participants who had no signs of these pathologies at the time of recruitment, it appears that people with light to moderate coffee consumption have a 12% lower risk of dying from the disease than those who do not drink coffee. For cardiovascular disease, the risk of death is reduced by as much as 17%, and for stroke it is reduced by as much as 21%. Among other findings, it should be emphasized that people who consume up to three cups of coffee a day have a healthier heart in terms of size and function, in line with a lower effect of aging on the organ.\nIn contrast, heavy coffee consumption appears to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with severe hypertension, but not in subjects without hypertension and with grade 1 hypertension (Teramoto et al., 2023).\nIn addition to caffeine and chlorogenic acids, many other minor components of coffee have been identified and studied, including polyphenols, diterpenes, melanoidins, and trigonelline. Researchers attribute these beneficial effects to the combined action of molecules in coffee, including kahweol and cafestol. In fact, coffee alone does not work miracles, since cardiovascular diseases are associated with other determining parameters of lifestyle, in particular diet (too much fat, too much sugar). It is possible, however, that coffee can make a difference with the same behavior. The beneficial effects of regular coffee consumption on the cardiovascular system could be explained by its antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antiarrhythmic and anti-atherosclerotic effects (Surma et al., 2023).\nCoffee consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans. In this context, N-caffeoyltryptophan, a component of coffee, enhances adipogenic differentiation and promotes glucose uptake into adipocytes, involving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and Sirtuin 1, ultimately leading to a reduction in postprandial glycemia (Sawamoto et al., 2023).\nHowever, contraindications to coffee consumption have also been reported; in fact, coffee can significantly interfere with the absorption of alendronate (a drug used to treat osteoporosis) and can reduce the effectiveness of iron supplements. Quinolone antibiotics can even increase the absorption of caffeine: in all these cases, it is advisable to limit the consumption of this drink. Coffee is also contraindicated if you suffer from hyperthyroidism and glaucoma or diseases of the intestines, stomach, liver, heart, kidneys, pancreas, nervous system (Garcia-Villanueva et al., 2022).\nWhat are the considerations regarding the use of decaffeinated coffee? Decaffeinated coffee is not completely caffeine-free: it contains a maximum of 0.1%, as opposed to 1.5\u20132% before decaffeination. It is therefore a coffee that has lost about 97% of its caffeine through processes. According to current legislation, a coffee can only be considered decaffeinated if the amount of caffeine is less than 0.1% of the dry product (Huaman\u00ed-Mel\u00e9ndez and Darros-Barbosa, 2018).\nThe main methods of caffeine extraction are: 1) removal by chemical solvents: mainly ethyl acetate and diclomethane; 2) the triglyceride method; 3) removal of caffeine by carbon dioxide; 4) the system through a water extractor.\nDecaffeinated coffee exists in nature and comes from a plant called Coffea charrieriana. However, its use is not widespread due to the rarity of this plant. The use of decaffeinated coffee is controversial for two main reasons. The first is that many manufacturers use a chemical process to remove the caffeine from the coffee beans. The result is less caffeine, but more chemicals. Second, it is the caffeine in coffee that provides the health and energy benefits. Without it, there are few benefits other than maintaining the coffee ritual.\nThe role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis and complications of several chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease, is well established. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of coffee have been investigated in numerous studies. There are more than 1000 chemical compounds in coffee. The compounds most known for their anti-inflammatory properties include caffeine, chlorogenic acid, trigonelline, melanoidins, caffeic acid, kahweol, and cafestol (Castaldo et al., 2021).\nInflammatory bowel disease cannot be controlled by diet alone. Certainly, some dietary indications can be very useful, especially during periods of disease activity. In particular, patients with ulcerative colitis often wonder whether coffee, one of the most popular drinks among Italians, should be strictly avoided. The answer is not unequivocal: at the moment, in fact, there is no certain evidence of the harmful effect of coffee and caffeine on the intestines of patients with this pathology, so no specific correlation has been found between the consumption of this drink and the progression of the disease (Campmans-Kuijpers and Dijkstra, 2021).\nMoreover, broad in vitro and in vivo studies have illustrated that coffee and its bioactive compounds show neuroprotective impacts suggesting their preventive and/or helpful potential for several neurodegenerative conditions (Di Meo et al., 2020; Ruggiero et al., 2022). Caffeine, in fact, lowers the risk of neurodegeneration in humans. In the short term, coffee may improve mood, alertness, learning and reaction time, and in the long term, it may protect against brain conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Alzheimer\u2019s disease causes memory loss, as well as cognitive and behavioural problems. Diet-related factors can influence the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. Observational studies have associated regular and moderate coffee consumption with up to a 65% lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, although the correlation is still being studied in depth (Ruggiero et al., 2022).\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. It is characterized by the death of nerve cells in the brain that secrete dopamine and are important for muscle movement. Parkinson\u2019s primarily affects movement and often includes tremors. Some studies show that coffee may help reduce the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease, with a 29% lower risk of developing the disease (Ruggiero et al., 2022). The caffeine contained in coffee appears to be the active ingredient capable of exerting these protective effects. Despite this, it is well known that neuroprotective effect of coffee is not due to caffeine alone, but to other bioactive components, such as polyphenols, including phenolic acid, i.e., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinin acid. These bioactive polyphenols are described to improve motor and cognitive performance both in aging and depression (Di Meo et al., 2020). In this respect, chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol derived from coffee determined neuroprotection against rotenone-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease by glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion (Sharma et al., 2022). Prospective studies are needed to gain further insight into the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling network implicated in the neuroprotective anti-inflammatory action of compounds present in coffee, other than caffeine, using in vivo models of Parkinson\u2019s disease as well as in the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease in a clinical setting.\nIn addition, there is evidence that suggest that habitual coffee consumption can potentially have positive impact on the course of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Wasim et al., 2020).\nAmong coffee compounds, caffeine surely has been the most extensively investigated in terms of neuroprotective effects, but the beneficial effects of coffee consumption can attributable not only to caffeine. Aside from caffeine, as already above mentioned, there are several other compounds in coffee that may independently determine particularly interesting protective effects in neurodegenerative conditions consequently paying attention to the possible use of decaffeinated coffee as a preventive and neuroprotective treatment. In this respect, other that polyphenolic acids, which include cholinergic acids and caffeic acid, the compound known as trigonelline looks the most promising one in terms of neuroprotection both in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in Parkinson\u2019s disease (Mirzaie et al., 2016; Fahanik-Babaei et al., 2019). Unfortunately, unlike caffeine, there are still no epidemiological or clinical studies on the protective value of the other coffee compounds in case of neurodegenerative disorders. Only preliminary data are present. For that reason, in-depth studies aimed at obtaining new information about the neuroprotective effect of coffee and its most promising bioactive compounds, represented by caffeine, coffee polyphenols, and trigonelline, are needed.\nTherefore, coffee consumption seems to be associated with a reduced risk of inflammatory diseases, whose mechanisms of action appear to be multidirectional. It should be noted that in many circumstances the beneficial effects associated with coffee intake are not always clear, as the same subjective inflammatory/oxidative profile can constitute a variable. The beneficial effects associated with coffee consumption are illustrated in Figure 1.\nAn interesting aspect of these studies is to provide information on possible nutraceutical treatments, assuming that the coffee constituents may have pharmacological effects, acting synergistically or antagonistically, used alone or in combination with other compounds to reduce drug intake and encourage the consumption of natural ingredients in adequate doses to promote health and fight disease by reducing unwanted risks and side effects of conventional drug therapies. Coffee is cheap and the favourite drink all over the world, thus the coffee consumption may provide a cost-effective and alluring preventive measure against chronic disease.\nFootnotes\nC-Editors: Zhao M, Liu WJ, Yu J; T-Editor: Jia Y\nReferences\n- 1.Campmans-Kuijpers MJE, Dijkstra G.
