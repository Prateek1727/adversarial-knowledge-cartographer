      "content": "Is coffee good or bad for your health?\nAlthough early studies of coffee suggested that it could lead to health problems, recent research provides strong evidence that drinking coffee actually has a variety of health benefits.\n\u201cThe overall evidence has been pretty convincing that coffee has been more healthful than harmful in terms of health outcomes,\u201d said Frank Hu, chair of the Department of Nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, in an April 5, 2021, article in Discover. \u201cFor most people, moderate coffee consumption can be incorporated into a healthy diet.\u201d\nHu said that moderate coffee intake\u2014about 2\u20135 cups a day\u2014is linked to a lower likelihood of type 2 diabetes, heart disease, liver and endometrial cancers, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and depression. It\u2019s even possible that people who drink coffee can reduce their risk of early death.\nEarly research linked coffee to diseases ranging from heart disease and asthma. But Hu noted that many participants in those studies also smoked, which may have led researchers to think that coffee was responsible for the adverse effects that are now linked with cigarettes. He added that anything people consume a lot of tends to come under scrutiny. \u201cIn the past, I think a lot of people thought, \u2018Oh, coffee\u2019s so delicious, there must be something bad about coffee,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo I think the good news is that [for] most people, coffee actually confers some health benefits.\u201d\nCertain groups should be careful about drinking coffee, according to the article. Not much is known about the effects of coffee on children, and caffeine could be harmful to pregnancies. Too much caffeine can also cause anxiety in people with panic or anxiety disorders.\nFor those who drink coffee, experts suggest brewing it with a paper filter, because unfiltered coffee is associated with higher rates of early death, and can contain compounds that raise levels of LDL, or \u201cbad,\u201d cholesterol. They also advise not going overboard with added cream or sugar.\nRead the Discover article: Is Coffee Good for You or Not?\nLearn more\nModerate coffee, tea consumption can be part of healthy lifestyle for most (Harvard Chan School news)\nCoffee can be beneficial part of a healthy diet (Harvard Chan School news)\nCoffee (The Nutrition Source)",

      "content": "Abstract\nMost people start their day with a cup of coffee. Many people would also finish their daily work with coffee. As such, coffee drinking is an important part of modern daily life. It has been told that coffee is a driving force for humans to develop science, because it has an alerting effect on the human brain. However, some people report experiencing irregular heartbeat or headaches and are thus reluctant to drink coffee, which suggests individual variation to coffee intolerance. The aim of this review is to briefly summarize the effects of coffee on human health.\nKeywords: caffeine, chlorogenic acid, coffee drinking, type 2 diabetes, hypertension\nCoffee has taken an important place in human society for at least 1200 years. Its consumption, which probably originated in northeast Africa, spread out to the Middle East in the 15th century and thence to Europe. After oil, coffee has become the second most valuable commodity around the world. Today, coffee is among the most widely consumed pharmacologically active beverages, and its consumption has become a regular part of daily life worldwide. It is estimated that more than half of Americans drink coffee every day. The average consumption for a person in the European Community is 5.1 kg/year, which is similar to that in the United States.1\nIn fact, coffee is a complex mixture of chemicals, and is the main source of caffeine in many populations. However, it also contains thousands of different chemicals, including carbohydrates, lipids, nitrogenous compounds, vitamins, minerals, alkaloids, and phenolic compounds (Fig. 1).2\nAlthough caffeine is a major component of coffee, the content is highly variable\u2014ranging between 30 mg and 175 mg in a cup (150 mL) of home-prepared coffee. Caffeine is the most widely consumed psychoactive drug worldwide and appears to exert most of its biological effects through the antagonism of the adenosine receptor. Adenosine is an endogenous inhibitory neuromodulator that prompts feelings of drowsiness, and thus caffeine induces generally stimulatory effects in the central nervous system. In addition, the physiological effects of caffeine intake include acute elevation of blood pressure, increasing metabolic rate, and diuresis.3 Based on the data reviewed, it can be concluded that moderate caffeine intake (2\u20133 cups or 300 mg/day) is not associated with adverse effects, such as cardiovascular stimulatory effects and behavioral changes, at least in healthy adults.4 However, caffeine is not completely harmless. In fact, caffeine crosses the human placenta, rapidly reaching a similar concentration in the fetus and mother. The excessive intake of caffeine has been implicated as a cause of spontaneous abortion or impaired fetal growth.3 Caffeine intake for women who plan to become pregnant and for women during gestation should not exceed 300 mg/day. In a variety of studies for caffeine ingestion, children can be defined as another risk group because altered behavior including nervousness or anxiety is found.3 It is judged that an intake of 2.5 mg/kg body weight/day is an upper limit of caffeine consumption in children (Federal Department of Health, Ottawa, Ontario, Canada).\nIs there an antioxidant in coffee? Yes, indeed. Coffee is the number one diet source of antioxidants in many countries including the United States, Italy, Spain, and Norway. Coffee beans contain phenolic antioxidant compounds. The major polyphenol in coffee is chlorogenic acid. Chlorogenic acid is one of the major strong antioxidant compounds in coffee.5 The antioxidant activity of coffee depends on the chemical composition. In addition, it was observed that the antioxidant activity of coffee varies according to the degree of roasting. Maximum antioxidant activity was measured for the medium-roasted coffee.6\nCoffee consumption has been associated with higher concentrations of serum total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein cholesterol. Cafestol and kahwoel are two diterpenes found in coffee oil. Diterpenes are the main cholesterol-raising compounds in coffee, but they are mostly removed by paper filters. Therefore, unfiltered coffee is a significant source of diterpenes, whereas the consumption of filtered coffee results in very little increase in serum cholesterol.7\nThe relationship of coffee with health has been featured in more than 8000 professional medical studies during the past 40 years. However, in many cases, conflicting findings and concerns have arisen, making it difficult for health professionals and the public to interpret the data. Coffee consumption tends to attract tobacco smoking, but many studies did not account for this potential confounding the data analysis.8 Some measurement errors seem to be inevitable in the assessment of coffee consumption, because people consume a wide variety of coffee from day to day. Coffee intake is determined by the size of the coffee cup and the strength of the brew as well as frequency of consumption. Despite 20 years of reassuring research, many people still avoid caffeinated coffee because they worry about the biological effects of caffeine. What is the conclusion of so much attention? We have thought that coffee is good for your health when consumed in moderation. Harvard Women's Health Watch (2004) reported that current research reveals that in moderation coffee is a safe beverage that may even offer some health benefits.9 However, it is also emphasized that difficulties and challenges in designing a solid experiment or clinical trials to elucidate the effects of coffee on human health are present.\nMany studies show that coffee consumption may help prevent several chronic diseases. In particular, long-term coffee consumption is associated with significant dose-dependent reductions in the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.4 Furthermore, coffee intake reduces the risk of liver damage in people at high risk for liver disease including hepatic injury, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.10 Its consumption is also inversely associated with the risk of Parkinson's disease in men and women who have never used postmenopausal estrogen.11 The risk of Alzheimer's disease is lower in those who regularly consume caffeine-containing coffee than in those who do not drink it.12 Coffee has also been shown to improve endurance performance in long-duration physical activities. It is very interesting that the relative risk of suicide was decreased by 13% for every cup of coffee consumed daily.13 In general, coffee consumption has been inversely associated with the risk of cancer at various sites including liver and colorectum, but there is no clear explanation of how coffee protects against cancer.14\nIt should be considered that coffee does have modest cardiovascular effects such as tachycardia, high blood pressure, and occasional arrhythmia.1 The acute effects of coffee on the cardiovascular system might arise in the time immediate to coffee intake or in more susceptible individuals. Recent analyses have concluded that a weak inverse association may exist between coffee consumption and the risk of stroke, but further research is needed to clarify this.14 Although there is no definite clinical relationship between coffee intake and the risk of cardiac arrhythmia, many doctors would not recommend coffee for the patients. Any contribution of coffee ingestion to the development of hypertension is likely to be small, but it is considerable particularly in infrequent coffee drinkers.4 Caffeine leads to a slight decrease in the efficiency of calcium absorption in gastrointestinal tract. Thus, an adequate intake of calcium and vitamin D and a limitation of coffee intake to 2\u20133 cups/day may help reduce the risk of osteoporosis and its related fracture particularly in elderly adults.3\nCoffee consumption is used for social activity, leisure, improvement of work performance, and well-being. Coffee is not only a medicinal alternative but also a beverage containing numerous potential health benefits. The results from many types of research suggest the positive effects of coffee consumption on various aspects of health, as mentioned above briefly. Despite the general good outcomes, it should be emphasized that individual sensitivity to coffee and the biological effects of coffee among humans may vary because of personal single nucleotide polymorphic variants, as shown in an investigation on genetic polymorphisms in apolipoprotein E (APOE).15 And some negative effects of coffee tend to emerge in excessive drinking, so it is the best to avoid heavy coffee intake. This minireview covers just a few of the health benefits and adverse effects associated with drinking coffee. Further studies on the functionally significant polymorphisms are needed for a better understanding of the effects of coffee on personal health.\nConflicts of interest\nAll contributing authors declare no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n- 1.Bonita J.S., Mandarano M., Shuta D., Vinson J.

This review examines coffee's multifaceted impact on health and well-being, drawing on decades of research. Overall, the consensus is that moderate coffee intake is more beneficial than harmful across a wide range of health outcomes. Numerous large-scale, prospective cohort studies from around the world have consistently shown that moderate coffee consumption-typically three to five cups per day-is associated with reduced overall mortality and lower risk of major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, stroke, respiratory conditions, cognitive decline, and potentially several types of cancer, including liver and uterine cancers. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee have shown benefits. The addition of sugar and cream to coffee may attenuate coffee's positive health effects. Despite historical concerns, coffee consumption is not linked to increased risks of cancer, hypertension, or arrhythmia. However, some concerns remain. For pregnant women, coffee consumption should be limited to lower amounts, such that the daily intake of caffeine does not exceed 200 mg/day. Also, excessive caffeinated coffee intake may cause anxiety or sleep disturbances. Coffee's health-promoting mechanisms include improved glucose balancing, increased physical activity, increased fat oxidation, improved lung function, and reduced inflammation. Beyond mortality and chronic diseases, coffee consumption affects many aspects of well-being: it supports hydration, boosts mental acuity, enhances physical performance, and may aid bowel recovery after surgery. While the field is well-studied via long-term observational cohorts, future research should focus on randomized controlled trials, Mendelian randomization studies, and granular analyses of coffee types and additives.\nKeywords: caffeine; cancer risk reduction; cardiovascular mortality; chronic disease prevention; coffee; cognitive decline mitigation; pregnancy and caffeine safety.\nConflict of interest statement\nDr. Kamangar has served as a consultant for the National Coffee Association.

      "content": "Turns out that coffee's good for more than jump-starting our mornings or keeping us awake during meetings. A lot of recent research suggests that coffee offers a host of potential health benefits.\nEvery day, Americans drink 400 million cups of this incredibly complex beverage, which contains more than 1,000 compounds that can affect the body. The most commonly studied are caffeine (a nervous-system stimulant that's known to have positive cognitive effects) and polyphenols (antioxidants that can help slow or prevent cell damage).\nWhat health benefits does coffee offer?\nThough researchers don't always know exactly which of coffee's ingredients are responsible for producing their studies' health-boosting results, there's evidence that drinking coffee may help do the following:\n1. Improve overall health.\nAn analysis of nearly 220 studies on coffee, published in the BMJ in 2017, found that coffee drinkers may enjoy more overall health benefits than people who don't drink coffee.\nThe analysis found that during the study period, coffee drinkers were 17% less likely to die early from any cause, 19% less likely to die of heart disease and 18% less likely to develop cancer than those who don't drink coffee.\n2. Protect against Type 2 diabetes.\nA 2014 study by Harvard researchers published in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16 to 20 years.\nThose who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17% higher risk of developing the disease.\nThe reason may be the antioxidants in coffee, which reduce inflammation (inflammation contributes to your Type 2 diabetes risk).\nIf you already have Type 2 diabetes, however, you should avoid caffeinated products, including coffee. Caffeine has been shown to raise both blood sugar and insulin levels in people with the disease.\n3. Control Parkinson's disease symptoms.\nA number of studies have suggested that consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease \u2014 and research published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.)\n4. Slow the progress of dementia.\nIn a 2012 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.\nWhen the researchers re-evaluated the subjects two to four years later, those whose blood levels contained caffeine amounts equivalent to about three cups of coffee were far less likely to have progressed to full-blown dementia than those who had consumed little or no caffeine.\n5. Safeguard the liver.\nSeveral studies published in respected journals have found that coffee drinking has beneficial effects on the liver, including reducing the risk of death from liver cirrhosis, decreasing harmful liver enzyme levels and limiting liver scarring in people who have hepatitis C.\n6. Promote heart health.\nAccording to a study published in 2021 in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure, drinking one or more daily cups of plain, caffeinated coffee was associated with a significant reduction in a person's long-term risk of heart failure.\nThe study looked at the original data from three well-known heart disease studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study.\nAlthough there's not enough evidence to support prescribing coffee to lower your risk of heart disease risk, this recent revelation seems to strengthen previous findings that coffee is, in fact, good for heart health.\nIn 2013, the journal Epidemiology and Prevention published a review of studies analyzing the correlation between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. Data from 36 different studies showed that people who drink three to five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of heart disease than those who drink no coffee or more than five cups per day.\nWhile the reason isn't clear, one possibility is that coffee helps to improve blood vessels' control over blood flow and blood pressure.\n7. Reduce melanoma risk.\nA 2015 study appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the coffee-drinking habits of more than 447,000 people over 10 years. The researchers found that those who drank four or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day had a 20% lower risk of developing melanoma than people who drank decaffeinated coffee or no coffee.\n8. Lower mortality risk\nYour morning coffee could help lower your risk of death. A 2022 study in The Annals of Internal Medicine has shown that moderate consumption of unsweetened and sugar-sweetened coffee was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. The research shows that those who drank 1.5 to 3.5 cups of coffee per day, including with sugar, had a 30% less lower risk of death from any cause during the study.\nAdvice for coffee drinkers\nWe asked Steven K. Rothschild, MD, a family medicine physician at Rush University Medical Center and a dedicated two- to-three-cup-a-day man (black, no sweetener) to weigh in.\nWhile he's never gone so far as to prescribe a daily dose of java for any of his patients, he says, \"I'm certainly familiar with a lot of research showing that coffee has a mildly beneficial effect in protecting against issues like stroke, diabetes and cardiovascular problems.\"\nHe offers a few caveats, however:\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors.\nDon't doctor up your drink.\n\"Keep in mind that the research focuses on the benefits of black coffee, which we're still learning about,\" Rothschild says. \"But we definitely know the harms associated with the fat and sugar you find in a lot of coffee drinks.\"\nA Starbucks Venti White Chocolate Mocha, for instance, has 580 calories, 22 grams of fat (15 of which are saturated) and 75 grams of sugar. A plain cup of brewed coffee? Two calories, no fat and zero carbs.\nIf you can't drink it black, stick with low-calorie, low-fat add-ins, such as skim milk or almond milk.\nCoffee is for grownups only.\n\"It's not true that coffee will stunt kids' growth, as parents used to be fond of saying,\" Rothschild says. But there are a few good reasons for kids not to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks (e.g., colas and energy drinks).\nOne study, published in 2014 in the journal Pediatrics, showed that even small amounts of caffeine, equivalent to one cup of coffee, increased children's blood pressure and \u2014 to compensate for the rise in blood pressure \u2014 slowed heart rates.\nBeyond that, Rothschild says, he'd be concerned about sleep disruption and behavioral issues that might result from ingesting a stimulant.\nSwitch to decaf if you have acid reflux ...\n\"Caffeine causes the gastroesophageal sphincter to relax, which allows acid to enter the esophagus,\" Rothschild explains.\n... or insomnia ...\n\"People who have trouble sleeping can get into a vicious cycle: They sleep badly, increase their caffeine intake the next day to compensate, then sleep badly again, and on and on,\" he says, suggesting that people with insomnia avoid all caffeine after noon.\n... or osteoporosis.\n\"There's some evidence showing that moderate to high coffee consumption \u2014 more than four cups per day \u2014 is linked with calcium loss and fractures,\" says Rothschild.\nBut if you do drink decaf, definitely limit your consumption. That study in Circulation: Heart Failure found that decaffeinated coffee was actually associated with an increased risk for heart failure.\nEnjoy coffee in moderation.\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, Rothschild says, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors. \"Unless you have a condition like reflux, it's fine to keep drinking a reasonable amount of coffee,\" he says.\nBut you can also try other healthy ways to get some of the benefits you might attribute to coffee.\n\"For instance, if you rely on coffee to fight after-lunch sluggishness every day, you might think about getting outside and going for a 10 to 20 minute walk,\" Rothschild suggests. \"It'll not only wake you up, but you'll also get a lot of benefits in terms of bone health and cardiovascular health.\"",

      "title": "Is Coffee Good For You? 15 Evidence-Based Coffee Benefits - ZOE",
      "content": "Updated 11th November 2025\nWhat are the health benefits of coffee?\nCoffee is a drink enjoyed by millions. And the latest research suggests that it might provide a range of health benefits.\nThese benefits are varied and likely stem from the vitamins and minerals within the bean itself. During brewing, these nutrients seep into the dark liquid.\nLet\u2019s dig into the research and look at the potential health benefits of coffee.\n1. Improves microbiome diversity\nYour gut microbiome contains trillions of microorganisms. And having a diverse gut microbiome is associated with good health.\nZOE\u2019s PREDICT studies found that coffee drinkers tended to have more diversity in their microbiomes. One possible explanation has to do with the soluble fiber and prebiotic properties in coffee that feed beneficial gut bugs.\nIn a ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast on coffee, Prof. Tim Spector, ZOE's scientific co-founder and an expert on the gut microbiome, explained:\n\"It's probably the drink you have regularly that contains the most fiber. There's more fiber in it than a glass of orange juice.\"\nThere's a long list of ways to improve your gut health, and it seems that coffee might be on that list.\n2. Improves cognitive function\nSome research suggests that coffee may be good for long-term cognitive health, including better memory and improved attention. However, other scientists haven't found this benefit.\nCoffee may also slow cognitive decline and lower your chances of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nInterestingly, caffeine alone may not be responsible. Studies in mice show that other compounds in coffee may contribute to these effects.\nA study comparing decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee didn't find any cognitive benefits linked to decaffeinated coffee.\nStill, a wide range of factors influence brain health, and scientists need to carry out much more research to understand the precise links between coffee and thinking ability.\n3. Reduces the risk of gallstone diseases\nDrinking coffee may reduce your risk of developing gallstones later in life.\nA recent study determined that drinking at least 6 cups a day was associated with a 23% reduced risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease, compared with drinking no coffee.\nBut if you currently have gallstones, you may want to avoid coffee, due to the stimulating effect it has on the gallbladder.\n4. Decreases cancer risk\nCoffee has dozens of compounds that may contribute to your health.\nFor instance, researchers recently showed that two compounds \u2014 kahweol and cafestol \u2014 stopped the growth of prostate and kidney cancer cells in a laboratory study.\nHowever, what happens in a test tube doesn't always match what happens in your body.\nWith that said, there is mounting evidence that coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of certain cancers, such as liver, prostate, breast, colorectal, and potentially endometrial cancer.\n5. Heals damaged cells\nAntioxidants help prevent and repair damage to cells and genetic material around your body.\nResearch has shown that coffee is a significant source of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant, in many people's diets. Polyphenols also help fuel your \"good\" gut bacteria.\nOne polyphenol in coffee is called chlorogenic acid. Some researchers have linked this antioxidant to metaboilic benefits. They believe that chlorogenic acid might reduce the risk of a range of conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and obesity.\nOther dietary sources of polyphenols include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though many people don\u2019t eat enough of these.\nTake a quiz to find out how personalized food recommendations can improve your health.\n6. Lowers the risk of Parkinson's disease\nCoffee may have neuroprotective properties and could lower the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer\u2019s).\nA number of studies have investigated and suggest that people who drink 5 or more cups of coffee a day may have a reduced risk.\nThere's also some evidence that drinking coffee might slow the progression of Parkinson's in people who already have it.\nHowever, scientists need to carry out more research in larger populations to confirm these findings.\nJoin our mailing list\nOpt in to receive ongoing science and nutrition emails, news and offers from ZOE.

It affects nearly 10% of people in the U.S.\nThe risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include having a sedentary lifestyle, being overweight, and being 45 or older.\nA review concluded that people who drink 4 or more cups of coffee a day had less risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who drank fewer than 2 cups a day.\nHowever, as the review's authors explain, scientists need to explore this connection further.\nA more recent review, published in 2018, found that the risk of diabetes dropped by 6% for each cup of coffee consumed daily.\n8. Improves bowel regularity\nWe\u2019re sure you saw this one coming. Coffee's laxative effect is well-known. Nearly a third of coffee drinkers report needing to use the bathroom within 30 minutes post-brew.\nIf you struggle to have regular bowel movements, coffee might be a healthy way to get things moving.\n9. Increases physical activity levels\nMany of us rely on coffee to give us a jolt of energy. So, it makes sense that this energy boost results in more exercise throughout the day.\nMiddle-aged female participants in a public health study were 17% more likely to reach their physical activity goals if they drank 1\u20132 cups of coffee each day, compared with participants who drank less coffee or none.\n10. Decreases stroke risk\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study, which evaluated 83,076 nurses\u2019 diets, found that moderate coffee consumption was modestly associated with decreased stroke risk.\nRecent research echoes this and suggests that people who drink between half a cup and 3 cups of coffee a day have a 21% lower risk of stroke than those who don\u2019t drink coffee.\nSimilarly, a review and meta-analysis using data from more than 2.4 million people also concluded that coffee was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.\n11. Helps maintain weight loss\nAs long as you don\u2019t load up your coffee with sweeteners, you might find that your morning caffeine habit contributes to weight loss.\nOne study found that coffee drinkers were more likely to keep weight off over time, compared with non-coffee drinkers.\nAlthough the evidence isn't super strong, a review and meta-analysis concluded that increased caffeine intake was linked to reduced body mass index, weight, and fat mass.\nThese effects might stem from caffeine\u2019s role as an appetite suppressant and its effect on metabolic activity.\n12. Protects liver health\nCoffee consumption is associated with a protective effect against chronic liver disease.\nFor instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that coffee protects against liver fibrosis in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \u2014 the most common cause of chronic liver disease.\nSimilarly, a large study with almost half a million participants found that 3\u20134 cups of coffee reduced the risk of all types of chronic liver disease. These conditions include cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.\n13. Decreases inflammation markers\nInflammation is a healthy response to injury or infection. However, if it continues for long periods when there's no injury or infection, it can cause health problems. This is called chronic inflammation.\nScientists have found links between chronic inflammation and conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nDiet, physical activity, and stress levels all contribute to how much chronic inflammation is present in your body.\nAccording to some scientists, coffee might help reduce inflammation. However, the relationship between inflammation and coffee is likely complex, and scientists need to do more work.\n14. Decreases the risk of heart disease\nEvidence is mounting that coffee may protect heart health. For instance, one large study concluded that coffee consumption was associated with a long-term lower risk of developing heart failure.\nAnd according to a review, drinking 3\u20135 cups a day is linked to a 15% reduction in cardiovascular disease, compared with drinking none.\nHowever, the authors note that people with high blood pressure or poorly controlled blood pressure shouldn't consume large amounts of caffeine.\nIn the ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast on coffee, Prof. Spector explains, \"It's only really the last 5 years that the evidence has accumulated so much that it's incontrovertible that coffee drinkers have less heart disease than non-coffee drinkers.\"\n15. Possibly lowers depression risk\nScientists have found that people who drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day have a significantly lower risk of developing depression than those who drink less than 1 cup a day.\nBut so far, studies have only been observational. This means that it's not possible to tease apart cause and effect.\nFor instance, it might be that people who don't have depression are more likely to drink more coffee, rather than coffee directly reducing depression risk.\nFor more information on the overall health benefits of coffee, watch the video of the ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast in which Prof. Tim Spector and James Hoffman spill the beans.\nCoffee and health considerations\nWith coffee, dosage really matters, and some people can tolerate more than others.\nAs Prof. Spector, explains, \u201cCaffeine tolerance is highly personal, and there are some factors that you can\u2019t control \u2014 such as your genes.\u201d\n\u201cOur latest PREDICT study showed that coffee drinkers have very different gut microbiomes, and this could also play a part in tolerance levels.\u201d\nPeople who metabolize coffee slowly tend to have jitters, anxiety, and sleep disruptions. Those who metabolize coffee quickly, however, often have very few side effects.\nExperimenting can help you recognize how much, if any, is right for you. If you drink coffee and notice anxiety, negative mood changes, sleep problems, or headaches, you might want to reduce your intake.\nPregnant women should be extra cautious. The recommended limit during pregnancy is 12 ounces \u2014 or 1.5 cups \u2014 per day.\nAs always, listening to your body is key.\nThe crunch your gut\u2019s* been craving.\nSupport gut health* and energy* and enhance the flavor and crunch of your meals.\nSummary\nIf you love coffee's ability to get you going in the morning, rest easy. You\u2019re probably receiving health benefits along with your caffeine fix.\nFrom diversifying your gut microbiome to lowering the risk of some conditions \u2014 coffee is a beloved beverage with plenty of perks.\nIf you want to learn more about the composition of your gut microbiome, check out ZOE\u2019s at-home test kit, and learn why there's no one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition.\nSources\nA daily cup of tea or coffee may keep you moving: Association between tea and coffee consumption and physical activity.

      "content": "Health effects of coffee\nThe health effects of coffee include various possible health benefits and health risks.[1]\nA 2017 umbrella review of meta-analyses found that drinking coffee is generally safe within usual levels of intake and is more likely to improve health outcomes than to cause harm at doses of 3 or 4 cups of coffee daily. Exceptions include possible increased risk in women having bone fractures, and a possible increased risk in fetal loss or decreased birth weight during pregnancy.[2] Results were complicated by poor study quality, and differences in age, gender, health status, and serving size.[2]\nDigestion\n[edit]A 1999 review found that coffee does not cause indigestion, but may promote gastrointestinal reflux.[3] Two reviews of clinical studies on people recovering from abdominal, colorectal, and gynecological surgery found that coffee consumption was safe and effective for enhancing postoperative gastrointestinal function.[4][5]\nIn some people, coffee induces defecation within minutes of consumption.[5][6][7][8] However, the specific mechanism of action and chemical constituents responsible are still unknown.[9]\nMortality\n[edit]A 2014 meta-analysis found that coffee consumption (4 cups/day) was inversely associated with all-cause mortality (a 16% lower risk), as well as cardiovascular disease mortality specifically (a 21% lower risk from drinking 3 cups/day), but not with cancer mortality[10] with exception being oral cancer mortality.[11]\nAdditional meta-analyses corroborated these findings, showing that higher coffee consumption (2\u20134 cups per day) was associated with a reduced risk of death by all disease causes.[12][13]\nCardiovascular disease\n[edit]Moderate coffee consumption is not a risk factor for coronary heart disease.[14]\nA 2012 meta-analysis concluded that people who drank moderate amounts of coffee had a lower rate of heart failure, with the biggest effect found for those who drank more than four cups a day.[15] A 2014 meta-analysis concluded that cardiovascular disease, such as coronary artery disease and stroke, is less likely with three to five cups of non-decaffeinated coffee per day but more likely with over five cups per day.[16] A 2016 meta-analysis showed that coffee consumption was associated with a reduced risk of death in patients who have had a myocardial infarction.[17] The effect of no or moderate daily consumption of coffee on risk for developing hypertension has been assessed in several reviews during the 21st century. A 2019 review found that one to two cups consumed per day did not affect hypertension risk, whereas drinking three or more cups per day reduced the risk,[18] a finding in agreement with a 2017 analysis which showed a 9% lower risk of hypertension with long-term consumption of up to seven cups of coffee per day.[19] Another review in 2018 found that the risk of hypertension was reduced by 2% with each cup per day increment of coffee consumption up to 8 cups per day, compared with people who did not consume any coffee.[20]\nA large 2024 study,[21] involving close to two hundred thousand participants using the UK Biobank, indicated that a habitual caffeine intake, at moderate levels of 200 mg \u2013 300 mg of caffeine per day \"was associated with a lower risk of new-onset CM [Cardiometabolic multimorbidity] and could play important roles in almost all transition phases of CM development.\" In particular, the study found that metabolites related to very low-density lipoproteins were reduced with higher metabolites related to high-density lipoproteins. The study found any caffeine intake, in general, reduced the risks of CM, although it did not find strong evidence that tea reduced the risk of stroke and Type 2 Diabetes.\nBy contrast, a 2011 review found that drinking one to three cups of coffee per day may pose a slightly increased risk of developing hypertension.[22]\nThe 2021 European Society of Cardiology Guidelines on Cardiovascular Disease Prevention in Clinical Practice state: \"Non-filtered coffee contains LDL-C-raising cafestol and kahweol, and may be associated with an up to 25% increased risk of atherosclerosis (ASCVD) mortality by consumption of nine or more drinks a day. Non-filtered coffee includes boiled, Greek, and Turkish coffee and some espresso coffees. Moderate coffee consumption (3\u20134 cups per day) is probably not harmful, perhaps even moderately beneficial\".[23]\nParkinson's disease\n[edit]Meta-analyses have consistently found that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of Parkinson's disease.[2]\nType II diabetes\n[edit]In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 28 prospective observational studies, representing over one million participants, every additional cup of caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee consumed in a day was associated, respectively, with a 9% and 6% lower risk of type 2 diabetes.[24]\nCancer\n[edit]Meta-analyses on the effects of coffee consumption on cancer risk are inconclusive.[25][26][27]\nThe World Health Organization's 2016 IARC Monograph \"found no conclusive evidence for a carcinogenic effect of drinking coffee\" but found that drinking very hot beverages probably causes cancer of the oesophagus.[28]\nLiver disease\n[edit]According to The British Liver Trust, regular consumption of coffee may support liver health and reduce the risk of some liver diseases.[29]\nMental health\n[edit]The UK National Health Service advises that avoiding coffee may reduce anxiety.[30] In chronic psychiatric patients, caffeine, the major active ingredient in coffee, is associated with anxiety.[31][32] At high doses, typically greater than 300 mg, caffeine can both cause and worsen anxiety.[33] For some people, discontinuing caffeine use can significantly reduce anxiety.[34] Caffeine-induced anxiety disorder is a subclass of substance- or medication-induced anxiety disorder.[35] Populations that may be most impacted by caffeine consumption are adolescents and people with anxiety disorders.[36] Preliminary research indicated the possibility of a beneficial relationship between coffee intake and reduced depression.[2][37][38] Long-term preliminary research, including assessment of symptoms for dementia and cognitive impairment, was inconclusive for coffee having an effect in the elderly, mainly due to the poor quality of the studies.[2][39]\nSee also\n[edit]References\n[edit]- ^ Myhrvold N (2024-06-08) [1999-07-26]. \"Coffee - Brewing, Roasting, Varieties\".

      "content": "If you\u2019re one of those folks who can\u2019t face the day without a cup of joe, here\u2019s a bit of good news: There\u2019s very little evidence that coffee is bad for you. In fact, it might actually be good for you, in moderation.\nIn 2012, the American Heart Association (AHA) published findings from a meta-analysis that drinking coffee in moderate amounts might help lower the risk for heart failure. The largest decrease in risk was observed in individuals who drank four cups of coffee daily. At the AHA\u2019s Scientific Sessions 2017, researchers presented updated findings that showed an association between drinking coffee and reduced risk of heart failure and stroke. This is not surprising, as coffee has a long history of benefits for people across the world.\nCoffee: The social common denominator\nThe history of coffee is as robust as the beverage itself. According to the National Coffee Association, coffee originated in Africa, then made its way to the Middle East, arriving in Europe in the 17th century. It was in Vienna, Austria, where coffee first established a pivotal role in ongoing social and political movements.\nCoffeehouses developed rapidly in Europe and in the Middle East as points of convergence of thinkers from all backgrounds \u2013 individuals (learned or not), academics, aristocrats, and, for the first time, commoners \u2013 came together to discuss art, religion, social events, and politics. In most countries, with Germany as an exception, women were not allowed to participate in coffeehouse-based events. These conversations became so enlightening and powerful that governments and religious leaders attempted to ban coffeehouses to reduce the risk of patrons speaking ill of their power. However, coffeehouse culture had become so ingrained across the continent that the royal ban in the UK lasted just one week.\nCoffee, its consumption, and the multidimensional social interchange triggered by its consumption, has been a powerful factor contributing to norms in current-day society. In fact, the social health benefits of coffee are clear \u2013 benefits no longer relegated exclusively to men. A mutual love of the beverage can bring people together to exchange ideas and rise against adversity. And today, we know that the beverage may offer physical health benefits as well.\n\u201cEnjoying coffee in moderation is safe for most people who follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, and it might, in fact, be a health-promoting strategy.\u201d\n\u2013 Joseph A. Hill, M.D., Ph.D.\nHow is coffee potentially good for you?\nCoffee is a complex beverage that consists of more than 200 different molecules. Some of those molecules are flavonoids \u2013 a type of antioxidant that might have heart-healthy or immune-protective properties. Research is underway to determine whether antioxidants really affect our health in a positive way and how the flavonoids in coffee compare to those in fruits and vegetables.\nA 2012 study suggested a decrease in mortality in people who consume more coffee. Keep in mind this was an association study only \u2013 other lifestyle factors that affect mortality were not considered. Much of the current research into the potential health benefits of coffee measures the association of coffee consumption with health benefits rather than whether it causes benefits. For example, one might associate using a cane with growing older, but using a cane doesn\u2019t cause aging. Similarly, the association between coffee consumption and decreased mortality likely involves, at least to some extent, other lifestyle factors such as eating a healthier diet, exercising more regularly, or having better access to health care.\nCaffeine also might promote insulin sensitivity. A 2007 study suggested that 200 mg of daily caffeine intake (one 8-ounce cup of coffee contains 80 mg to 100 mg of caffeine) can reduce the amount of insulin required to turn calories into energy \u2013 potentially reducing the risk for type 2 diabetes. Also, the more insulin circulating in our bodies, the hungrier we tend to feel. However, there is not enough research-based evidence to suggest that coffee helps people lose weight, nor can we say for certain that drinking coffee prevents diabetes.\nStudies over the past two decades also link coffee consumption with decreased risk of prostate cancer and endometrial cancer. Again, these epidemiological studies suggest a link between coffee and reduced risk but don\u2019t exclude other factors that travel with coffee consumption, such as lifestyle and genetics, which together could play a part in overall risk.\nCoffee also has been examined for its benefits in athletes. The American College of Sports Medicine has found that caffeine consumed prior to exercise increases athletic performance for prolonged endurance exercise or short bursts of intense exercise in elite or serious recreational athletes. But how caffeine works to improve performance is not fully understood.\nAnd, of course, most of us are familiar with the mental effects of coffee. As one Civil War soldier wrote in his diary, \u201cNobody can soldier without coffee.\u201d Coffee provides a number of useful benefits to help us all get through the day, including:\n- Faster reaction speed\n- Improved job performance due to lessened fatigue\n- Improved mood and alertness\nHow is coffee potentially bad for you?\nThe good news is that there isn\u2019t much evidence that plain, black coffee is bad for you. However, that does come with a few considerations. If you\u2019re sensitive to caffeine, coffee could well affect you differently than it affects others. For some health conditions, including heart issues, your doctor might suggest you avoid or limit your caffeine intake. That includes coffee, chocolate, green tea, and other sources of caffeine. That said, a study published in January 2016 found that for those with healthy hearts, drinking or eating caffeine in moderate amounts will not cause arrhythmia or heart palpitations.\nBut there could be other serious effects of drinking coffee. A 2001 study uncovered a 20 percent increase in urinary tract cancer risk in people who drink coffee but not in individuals who drink tea. The same findings were noted in a 2015 meta-analysis. For individuals with a family history of urinary tract cancer, it might be wise to avoid coffee until further research proves or disproves these associations.\nCoffee is a mild diuretic \u2013 drinking too much coffee can contribute to dehydration. A few cups a day won\u2019t make you dehydrated. However, if you consume coffee beverages for an energy boost during your workout, you might lose more sweat than normal. Some people sip coffee throughout the day when they really ought to be drinking water. If you drink mostly coffee and little water all day, every day, that is likely not an optimal way to hydrate your body.\nStudies touting the health benefits of coffee almost always refer to \u201cblack\u201d coffee \u2013 no cream, sugar, flavored syrups, or whipped topping. But that\u2019s not how many of us drink coffee. It\u2019s easy to get carried away and add a few hundred extra calories to your coffee without realizing it. Single-serve plain liquid creamers contain 15 calories each, and single-serve sugar also contains 15 calories per packet. That adds up fast, considering many coffee drinkers use more than this per cup. Some gourmet coffee drinks pack 300 to 400 calories for a small serving!\nPlain black coffee, on the other hand, contains just 2 calories per 8-ounce serving, and a 1-ounce serving of plain espresso contains just 1 calorie. Consuming excess calories, especially empty calories with no nutritional value, contributes to weight gain and type 2 diabetes. Opt for coffee with as few add-ins as possible.\nIf you can\u2019t tolerate black coffee, flavored coffee beans are a good option to add taste without adding calories. Skip sugar and try sugar-free syrups or add cinnamon to your coffee for a kick of flavor. You also might consider using skim milk or unsweetened almond milk instead of creamer or whipped topping to save on calories and add nutritional value.\nHow much caffeine is in my coffee?\nEarlier, I noted that an 8-ounce cup of coffee has about 80 mg to 100 mg of caffeine. The variation greatly depends on the type of bean or grounds you brew, as well as on how you prepare the beverage:\n- Espresso machines: An espresso maker pushes water through the grounds as fast as possible. This extracts many of the flavorful compounds and leaves much of the caffeine behind. Surprisingly to some, espresso has less caffeine than regular coffee when serving sizes (1 ounce versus 8 ounces) are compared.\n- Percolators: This is the type of machine my parents used to have, which runs water through the grounds over and over. A percolator picks up a lot of caffeine because of the multiple passes.\n- French press: This method is similar to the percolator and also delivers a lot of caffeine. It\u2019s called a \u201cpress\u201d because, after infusing the grounds with hot water, you press the grounds with the machine\u2019s plunger to separate them from the water.\n- Drip machines: These machines are in between. The caffeine extracted as the water zips through the grounds emerges right into the pitcher, but many of the flavonoids stick to the paper filter. However, if you use a steel filter, the flavonoids follow the water through to the pitcher.\n- Single-serve coffee makers: These work similar to espresso machines, which zip the water through the grounds quickly.\nFor the average, healthy person, the AHA recommends limiting caffeine consumption to 400 mg or less daily \u2013 to stay within that range, that\u2019s about four 8-ounce cups of coffee. Enjoying coffee in moderation is safe for most people who follow a heart-healthy lifestyle, and might, in fact, be a health-promoting strategy, both socially and physically.\nStay on top of health care news.

      "content": "Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren\u2019t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.\nPlant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including cafestol and kahweol\nOne 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nCoffee and Health\nCoffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50\u2013300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?\nCancer\nCoffee may affect how cancer develops, ranging from the initiation of a cancer cell to its death. For example, coffee may stimulate the production of bile acids and speed digestion through the colon, which can lower the amount of carcinogens to which colon tissue is exposed. Various polyphenols in coffee have been shown to prevent cancer cell growth in animal studies. Coffee has also been associated with decreased estrogen levels, a hormone linked to several types of cancer. [5] Caffeine itself may interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells. [6] Coffee also appears to lower inflammation, a risk factor for many cancers.\nThe 2018 uproar in California due to warning labels placed on coffee products stemmed from a chemical in the beverage called acrylamide, which is formed when the beans are roasted. Acrylamide is also found in some starchy foods that are processed with high heat like French fries, cookies, crackers, and potato chips. It was classified in the National Toxicology Program\u2019s 2014 Report on Carcinogens, as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\u201d based on studies in lab animals. However, there is not yet evidence of a health effect in humans from eating acrylamide in food. Regardless, in March 2018 a California judge ruled that all California coffee sellers must warn consumers about the \u201cpotential cancer risk\u201d from drinking coffee, because coffee-selling companies failed to show that acrylamide did not pose a significant health risk. California\u2019s law Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, fueled the ruling, which requires a warning label to be placed on any ingredient from a list of 900 confirmed or suspected carcinogens.\nHowever, many cancer experts disputed the ruling, stating that the metabolism of acrylamide differs considerably in animals and humans, and the high amount of acrylamide used in animal research is not comparable to the amount present in food. They cited the beneficial health effects of coffee, with improved antioxidant responses and reduced inflammation, both factors important in cancer prevention. Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee may reduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk for the cancers that were studied.\nIn June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation exempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review.\nType 2 Diabetes\nAlthough ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body.\nIn a meta-analysis of 45,335 people with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 20 years, an association was found with increasing cups of coffee and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Compared with no coffee, the decreased risk ranged from 8% with 1 cup a day to 33% for 6 cups a day. Caffeinated coffee showed a slightly greater benefit than decaffeinated coffee. [7]\nAnother meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed similar associations. When comparing the highest intake of coffee (up to 10 cups a day) with the lowest (<1 cup), there was a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in those drinking the highest amounts of coffee and caffeine and a 20% decreased risk when drinking decaffeinated coffee. Further analysis showed that the incidence of diabetes decreased by 12% for every 2 extra cups of coffee a day, and 14% for every 200 mg a day increase in caffeine intake (up to 700 mg a day). [8]\nHeart health\nCaffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system that can cause different reactions in people. In sensitive individuals, it can irritate the stomach, increase anxiety or a jittery feeling, and disrupt sleep. Although many people appreciate the temporary energy boost after drinking an extra cup of coffee, high amounts of caffeine can cause unwanted heart palpitations in some.\nUnfiltered coffee, such as French press and Turkish coffees, contains diterpenes, substances that can raise bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Espresso coffee contains moderate amounts of diterpenes. Filtered coffee (drip-brewed coffee) and instant coffee contain almost no diterpenes as the filtering and processing of these coffee types removes the diterpenes.\nDespite these factors, evidence suggests that drinking coffee regularly may lower the risk of heart disease and stroke:\nAmong 83,076 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, drinking 4 or more cups of coffee each day was associated with a 20% lower risk of stroke compared with non-drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee also showed an association, with 2 or more cups daily and a 11% lower stroke risk. The authors found no such association with other caffeinated drinks such as tea and soda. These coffee-specific results suggest that components in coffee other than caffeine may be protective. [9]\nA large cohort of 37,514 women concluded that moderate coffee drinking of 2-3 cups a day was associated with a 21% reduced risk of heart disease. [10]\nIn addition, a meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies of men and women looking at coffee consumption and death from chronic diseases found a link between moderate coffee consumption (3 cups per day) and a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease deaths compared with non-drinkers. [11]\nAnother meta-analysis of 36 studies including men and women reviewed coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular diseases (including heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and deaths from these conditions). It found that when compared with the lowest intakes of coffee (average 0 cups), a moderate coffee intake of 3-5 cups a day was linked with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Heavier coffee intake of 6 or more cups daily was neither associated with a higher nor a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. [12]\nDepression\nNaturally occurring polyphenols in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee can act as antioxidants to reduce damaging oxidative stress and inflammation of cells. It may have neurological benefits in some people and act as an antidepressant. [13] Caffeine may affect mental states such as increasing alertness and attention, reducing anxiety, and improving mood. [14] A moderate caffeine intake of less than 6 cups of coffee per day has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide. However in a few cases of sensitive individuals, higher amounts of caffeine may increase anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Suddenly stopping caffeine intake can cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, and low mood for a few days and may persist for up to a week. [15]\nA prospective cohort study following 263,923 participants from the National Institutes of Health and American Association of Retired Persons found that those who drank 4 or more cups of coffee a day were almost 10% less likely to become depressed than those who drank none. [15]\nIn a meta-analysis of observational studies including 330,677 participants, the authors found a 24% reduced risk of depression when comparing the highest (4.5 cups/day) to lowest (<1 cup) intakes of coffee. They found an 8% decreased risk of depression with each additional cup of coffee consumed. There was also a 28% reduced risk of depression comparing the highest to lowest intakes of caffeine, with the greatest benefit occurring with caffeine intakes between 68 and 509 mg a day (about 6 oz. to 2 cups of coffee). [16]\nA review looking at three large prospective cohorts of men and women in the U.S. found a decreasing risk of suicide with increasing coffee consumption. When compared with no-coffee drinkers, the pooled risk of suicide was 45% lower among those who drank 2-3 cups daily and 53% lower among those who drank 4 or more cups daily. There was no association between decaffeinated coffee and suicide risk, suggesting that caffeine was the key factor, rather than plant compounds in coffee. [17]\nNeurodegenerative diseases\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is mainly caused by low dopamine levels. There is consistent evidence from epidemiologic studies that higher consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk of developing PD. The caffeine in coffee has been found in animal and cell studies to protect cells in the brain that produce dopamine.\nA systematic review of 26 studies including cohort and case-control studies found a 25% lower risk of developing PD with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee. It also found a 24% decreased risk with every 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. [18]\nA Finnish cohort study tracked coffee consumption and PD development in 6,710 men and women over 22 years. In that time, after adjusting for known risks of PD, those who drank at least 10 cups of coffee a day had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease than non-drinkers. [19]\nA large cohort of men and women were followed for 10 and 16 years, respectively, to study caffeine and coffee intake on PD. The results showed an association in men drinking the most caffeine (6 or more cups of coffee daily) and a 58% lower risk of PD compared with men drinking no coffee. Women showed the lowest risk when drinking moderate intakes of 1-3 cups coffee daily. [20]\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease: In the CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) study, drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day at midlife (mean age 50 years) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease later in life compared with low coffee drinkers after 21 years of follow-up. [2]\nHowever, three systematic reviews were inconclusive about coffee\u2019s effect on Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to a limited number of studies and a high variation in study types that produced mixed findings. Overall the results suggested a trend towards a protective effect of caffeine against late-life dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but no definitive statements could be made. The authors stated the need for larger studies with longer follow-up periods. Randomized controlled trials studying a protective effect of coffee or caffeine on the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia are not yet available. [21-23]\nGallstones\nThere are various proposed actions of caffeine or components in coffee that may prevent the formation of gallstones. The most common type of gallstone is made of cholesterol. Coffee may prevent cholesterol from forming into crystals in the gallbladder. It may stimulate contractions in the gallbladder and increase the flow of bile so that cholesterol does not collect. [24]\nA study of 46,008 men tracked the development of gallstones and their coffee consumption for 10 years. After adjusting for other factors known to cause gallstones, the study concluded that men who consistently drank coffee were significantly less likely to develop gallstones compared to men who did not. [24] A similar large study found the same result in women. [25]\nMortality\nIn a large cohort of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, an association was found between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and lower risk of early death. Compared with non-drinkers, those who drank 3-5 cups of coffee daily were 15% less likely to die early from all causes, including cardiovascular disease, suicide, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee provided benefits. The authors suggested that bioactive compounds in coffee may be responsible for interfering with disease development by reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. [26]\nIn a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 people followed for 10 years, an association was found between drinking higher amounts of coffee and lower rates of death from all causes. Compared with non-drinkers, those drinking 6-7 cups daily had a 16% lower risk of early death. [26] A protective association was also found in those who drank 8 or more cups daily. The protective effect was present regardless of a genetic predisposition to either faster or slower caffeine metabolism. Instant and decaffeinated coffee showed a similar health benefit.\nThe bottom line: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\nWhat about iced coffee?\nTypes\nCoffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.\nType of bean.There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.\nType of roast.Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.\nType of grind. A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.\nDecaffeinated coffee. This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.\nWatch out for hidden calories in coffee drinks\nA plain \u201cblack\u201d cup of coffee is a very low calorie drink\u20148 ounces only contains 2 calories! However, adding sugar, cream, and milk can quickly bump up the calorie counts. A tablespoon of cream contains 52 calories, and a tablespoon of whole milk contains 9 calories. While 9 calories isn\u2019t a lot, milk is often poured into coffee without measuring, so you may be getting several servings of milk or cream in your coffee. A tablespoon of sugar contains 48 calories, so if you take your coffee with cream and sugar, you\u2019re adding over 100 extra calories to your daily cup.\nHowever, the real caloric danger occurs in specialty mochas, lattes, or blended ice coffee drinks. These drinks are often super-sized and can contain anywhere from 200-500 calories, as well as an extremely large amount of sugar. With these drinks, it\u2019s best to enjoy them as a treat or dessert, and stick with plain, minimally sweetened coffee on a regular basis\nStore\nPlace beans or ground coffee in an airtight opaque container at room temperature away from sunlight. Inside a cool dark cabinet would be ideal. Exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light can strip coffee of its flavor. Coffee packaging does not preserve the coffee well for extended periods, so transfer larger amounts of coffee to airtight containers.\nCoffee can be frozen if stored in a very airtight container. Exposure to even small amounts of air in the freezer can lead to freezer burn.\nMake\nFollow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water.\nFor optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time.\nUse ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks.\nDid You Know?\nIt is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration!\nCoffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a pleasant coffee flavor.\nWhile water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the coffee.\nRelated\nCaffeine\nCaffeine is naturally found in the fruit, leaves, and beans of coffee, cacao, and guarana plants. It is also added to beverages and supplements. Learn about sources of caffeine, and a review of the research on this stimulant and health.\nJe Y, Liu W, and Giovannucci E.

      "title": "Is coffee in the morning good for you? - BHF",
      "content": "You might enjoy a cup of coffee to help you feel more awake in the morning, but could it also be good for your heart?\nIn January, UK newspapers reported on research that found that drinking coffee in the mornings could reduce the risk of dying from a heart attack or stroke by almost a third.\nWhile coffee has previously been linked to a reduced risk of heart and circulatory diseases, it\u2019s been unclear if people who drink a lot (more than 3 to 5 cups a day) also have a lower risk.\nHowever, researchers behind a new study published in the European Heart Journal have claimed it\u2019s not how much coffee you drink, but when you drink it that matters.\nTheir study looked at data on how much caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee around 40,000 adults from the United States drank every day.\nAbout 36 per cent of the people included in the study mainly drank coffee in the morning (between 4am and 12pm), 16 per cent drank it in the morning, afternoon and evening, and 48 per cent did not drink coffee at all. None of them had a heart or circulatory disease at the start of the research.\nWant to get fit and healthy?\nSign up to our fortnightly Heart Matters newsletter to receive healthy recipes, new activity ideas, and expert tips for managing your health. Joining is free and takes 2 minutes.\nI\u2019d like to sign-up\nThey found that people who mainly drank coffee in the morning were 31 per cent less likely than non-coffee drinkers to die from a heart or circulatory disease after an average of 10 years, and 16 per cent less likely to die from any cause.\nIn comparison, people who drank coffee throughout the day did not have a significantly lower risk of dying over the following decade than those who did not have any coffee.\nWhile morning coffee drinkers had a reduced risk of dying no matter how many cups they drank a day, morning drinkers who had 2 to 3 cups had the lowest risk \u2013 they were nearly half as likely to die from a heart or circulatory disease as those who drank none.\nThe study also looked at people\u2019s risk of dying from cancer, but did not find that drinking coffee at any time of day had a significant impact on their risk.\nWhat did the researchers say?\nIn the study, the researchers said that drinking coffee with caffeine in the afternoons and evenings may disrupt people\u2019s body clock. They noted that previous trials have shown that drinking coffee late in the day can reduce people\u2019s levels of a hormone called melatonin, which controls the sleep cycle.\nThey wrote that this could have lessened any other benefits of coffee, as there is evidence that lower levels of melatonin are linked to a higher risk of heart and circulatory disease.\nBut the researchers said that this explanation would not apply to people drinking decaf coffee, which does not affect melatonin levels.\nThe researchers also wrote that drinking coffee in the morning might have reduced the risk of dying of heart and circulatory diseases because both decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee contain substances which may reduce inflammation in the body.\nChronic inflammation can increase the risk of fatty material (plaques) building up in the blood vessels, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke.\nThe researchers suggested that morning drinkers may benefit the most from coffee\u2019s potential anti-inflammatory effects, as some molecules in the blood that cause inflammation are more active earlier in the day.\nHowever, more research is needed to confirm if coffee can directly reduce inflammation in the body.\nHow good was the research?\nThe study was observational, which means that while it showed people who only drank coffee in the morning had a lower risk of dying, it cannot prove that this was caused by drinking coffee.\nThe researchers did adjust for lots of factors that may have also affected people\u2019s risk of heart and circulatory disease, such as their age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure and how much sleep they got.\nHowever, they admitted that there may have been other factors they did not consider. For example, people who work night shifts \u2013 who have a higher risk of heart problems \u2013 may tend to drink coffee later in the day.\nAlso, while the study was large, it used self-reported data. In the study, 40,725 people were asked to report everything they had eaten or drunk over the last 24 hours 3 separate times over several years, and 1,463 people also recorded what they had consumed over the previous 7 days, 2 times around 6 months apart.\nThis method of collecting data could affect the accuracy of the results, as people may have misremembered exactly when and how much coffee they drank during the day.\nHow good was the media coverage?\nLots of UK media outlets wrote about the study, including The Guardian, the Daily Mail, The Times and The Telegraph.\nWhile all of these newspapers said that the findings may be caused by coffee affecting melatonin levels and disturbing sleep, only The Guardian mentioned that the study included decaffeinated coffee, which would not have this effect.\nAnd the Daily Mail\u2019s headline, which suggested drinking coffee at a specific time of day \u201ccan slash the risk of a heart attack and stroke by a third\u201d, was inaccurate. The study actually looked at people\u2019s risk of dying from heart or circulatory diseases such as heart attacks or strokes.\nThe BHF verdict\n\"We already know that drinking coffee in moderation, about 4 to 5 cups a day, is generally fine for most people and does not seem to negatively impact heart health. However, this study suggests that the time of day you drink coffee also matters,\u201d says Tracy Parker, a Senior Dietitian at British Heart Foundation.\n\u201cIt's important to note that this type of study cannot prove cause and effect, so we cannot say for certain that enjoying a cup of coffee with your breakfast will directly reduce your chances of dying from a heart attack or stroke.\n\u201cNonetheless, having your coffee earlier in the day rather than late at night is unlikely to be harmful and could benefit your heart health,\u201d she advises.\nIf you find that drinking coffee in the afternoon or evening affects your sleep, try to reduce your caffeine intake or switch to decaf after midday to help you get a better night\u2019s rest.\nWhat to read next...",
