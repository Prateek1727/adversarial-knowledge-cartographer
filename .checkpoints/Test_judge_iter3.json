      "content": "Test\nA test is a way of checking something to see if it is true, or false, or if it is edible or not. If something can be tested, or finishes the tests correctly, it is testable. The Concise Oxford English Dictionary defines a test as: \"a procedure intended to establish the quality, performance, or reliability of something\".[1]\nA test is different from an experiment: Before a test is done, there is an expected result. The test is performed, to show this result. In an experiment, the outcome is open. Very often, tests are performed as part of an experiment.\nProducts\n[change | change source]Products are usually tested for quality, so customers will get good products.\nIn software engineering, a test is used to see if the software system can do what it should. Software is tested before it is released. Alpha testing is where software developers check the software for bugs. Software can also be checked for quality and usability. Beta testing is done by groups of users.\nTests of cars and other vehicles include a crash test. The car is put under severe conditions to see what will make it fail, or deliberately crashed to measure the damage. Other machines can also be crash tested. Crash test dummies can be used instead of humans. They are placed in the car seat to see if a human in the crash would have been injured or killed.\nPeople\n[change | change source]People are tested to see what they have learned. This is often called an assessment or examination. In learning, a test item is a question, or set of questions.\nMany people think tests are valuable. They believe tests:\n- are a quick and fair way of judging a test taker's performance\n- enable predictions about test takers to be made\n- allow selection\n- improve performance by highlighting areas that need work.\nHowever, academic tests are not perfect measures. Tests could only partly measure a student\u2019s memory and maybe their understanding. The test would only be about a small part of the subject, and only at that moment in time.\nPeople, animals and plants can also be tested for illnesses. For example, a blood test can be used to check for disease.\nScience\n[change | change source]In science, tests can done to check for a presence of a substance, or to check the quality of something.\nReferences\n[change | change source]- \u2191 Stevenson, Angus; Waite, Maurice (2011).

Tests are detailed or small-scale task carried out to identify the candidate\u2019s level of performance and to find out how far the person has learnt what was taught or be able to do what he/she is expected to do after teaching. Tests are carried out in order to measure the efforts of the candidate and characterize the performance. Whenever you are tested, it is to find out what you know, what you do not know, or even what you partially know. Test is therefore an instrument for [...] Tests are used to place students/candidates into a particular class, school, level, or employment. Such tests are called placement tests. The assumption here is that an individual who performs creditably well at a level can be moved to another level after testing. Thus, we use tests to place a pupil into primary two, after he/she has passed the test set for primary one, and so on. v. Tests can reveal the problems or difficulty areas of a learner.
