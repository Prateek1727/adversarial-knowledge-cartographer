      "content": "Designed by Jason Tham, the infographic presents information from sources including the SCAA and the Harvard School of Public Health in two columns: pros (the good angel), and cons (the bad angel wing). It is worth noting that the benefits of coffee consumption, such as reduced risk of strokes, Parkinson\u2019s and Alzheimer\u2019s, far outweigh the negatives, which include minor inconveniences such as staining of the teeth and sleep disruption. So put this on the wall of your retail space or roastery [...] A daily consumable, coffee has long been a darling of the medical science community and the mainstream media. We see stories and studies on coffee\u2019s effects on mental and physical health on a daily basis, and now it seems we\u2019ve reached a kind of boiling point at which consumers are asking, \u201cIs coffee saving my life or is it killing me?\u201d To most people, the question may be irrelevant (what is life without coffee?), but here we present a handy infographic, should a customer or loved one come to [...] Thumbs up for that infographic! Antioxidant activity is greatly affected by the coffee\u2019s method of preparation. When coffee is roasted, it contains a larger amount of antioxidants compared to non-roasted coffee, and thus gives you more health benefits.

      "content": "Coffee is one of the world\u2019s favorite and most popular beverages, the third most popular beverage after water and tea. For many people, it is an indispensable habit before going to work and a socialization tool for the rest of the day. In general, the average consumption varies from 2 to 6 cups per day. What are the health implications? Given this consumption, the benefits are actually greater than the risks. This is the conclusion of a careful study published in the New England Journal of Medicine (van Dam et al., 2020).\nThe beneficial pharmacological effects of coffee, as demonstrated by numerous scientific studies, are related to its anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, antiangiogenic, anticancer, chemoprotective and hepatoprotective properties (Doepker et al., 2022; Ruggiero et al., 2022). Coffee contains more than a thousand compounds, many of which have yet to be discovered. Several phytochemicals have been described as coffee components, including alkaloids (caffeine, trigonelline, adenine-7-glucosyl, theobromine, and 7-methylxanthine), flavonoids (anthocyanins, quercetin glucoside, quercetin, isoquercitrine, rutin, and kaempferol), terpenoids (kahweol, cafestol, and 16-O-methyl cafestol), amino acids (histidine and pipecolic acid), sucrose, tannins, xanthonoids (mangiferin and isomangiferin), phenolic acids (caffeic, chlorogenic, p-coumaric, ferulic, and sinapic acids), and catechins (catechin and epicatechin).\nMany authors have studied the effects of caffeine and its major constituents in clinical and cellular experiments (Doepker et al., 2022; Ruggiero et al., 2022; Teramoto et al., 2023). However, the published results are controversial regarding its effects on different types of pathologies. Moderate coffee consumption in good health, with the exception of some phases of a woman\u2019s life (pregnancy and lactation), can have beneficial effects, significantly reducing various chronic diseases. A recent study reports that coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of head and neck cancer; in this regard, meta-analyses consistently report a beneficial relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality, concluding that approximately 6% of years of healthy life lost would be prevented if all consumers drank three cups of coffee per day (Doepker et al., 2022).\nCoffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing chronic liver disease (Kolb et al., 2020). The beneficial effect would be independent of the type of coffee: it is good whether it is instant, ground or decaffeinated and is associated with a reduced risk of chronic liver disease, including hepatitis (Kennedy et al., 2021). In addition, there are studies reporting that increased coffee consumption is associated with lower circulating hepatitis B virus DNA and hepatitis B surface antigen levels and reduces the development of hepatitis B virus-associated hepatocellular cancer (Kakiyama et al., 2022).\nIt is reported that regular and moderate consumption of coffee can reduce the risk of death and the risk of death from cardiovascular causes. In fact, a study conducted by Simon et al. (2022), focuses that regular coffee consumption plays a role in protecting against cardiovascular disease. From the results of this analysis, which included 468,629 participants who had no signs of these pathologies at the time of recruitment, it appears that people with light to moderate coffee consumption have a 12% lower risk of dying from the disease than those who do not drink coffee. For cardiovascular disease, the risk of death is reduced by as much as 17%, and for stroke it is reduced by as much as 21%. Among other findings, it should be emphasized that people who consume up to three cups of coffee a day have a healthier heart in terms of size and function, in line with a lower effect of aging on the organ.\nIn contrast, heavy coffee consumption appears to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease mortality in patients with severe hypertension, but not in subjects without hypertension and with grade 1 hypertension (Teramoto et al., 2023).\nIn addition to caffeine and chlorogenic acids, many other minor components of coffee have been identified and studied, including polyphenols, diterpenes, melanoidins, and trigonelline. Researchers attribute these beneficial effects to the combined action of molecules in coffee, including kahweol and cafestol. In fact, coffee alone does not work miracles, since cardiovascular diseases are associated with other determining parameters of lifestyle, in particular diet (too much fat, too much sugar). It is possible, however, that coffee can make a difference with the same behavior. The beneficial effects of regular coffee consumption on the cardiovascular system could be explained by its antihypertensive, antidiabetic, antiarrhythmic and anti-atherosclerotic effects (Surma et al., 2023).\nCoffee consumption has been shown to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus in humans. In this context, N-caffeoyltryptophan, a component of coffee, enhances adipogenic differentiation and promotes glucose uptake into adipocytes, involving mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling and Sirtuin 1, ultimately leading to a reduction in postprandial glycemia (Sawamoto et al., 2023).\nHowever, contraindications to coffee consumption have also been reported; in fact, coffee can significantly interfere with the absorption of alendronate (a drug used to treat osteoporosis) and can reduce the effectiveness of iron supplements. Quinolone antibiotics can even increase the absorption of caffeine: in all these cases, it is advisable to limit the consumption of this drink. Coffee is also contraindicated if you suffer from hyperthyroidism and glaucoma or diseases of the intestines, stomach, liver, heart, kidneys, pancreas, nervous system (Garcia-Villanueva et al., 2022).\nWhat are the considerations regarding the use of decaffeinated coffee? Decaffeinated coffee is not completely caffeine-free: it contains a maximum of 0.1%, as opposed to 1.5\u20132% before decaffeination. It is therefore a coffee that has lost about 97% of its caffeine through processes. According to current legislation, a coffee can only be considered decaffeinated if the amount of caffeine is less than 0.1% of the dry product (Huaman\u00ed-Mel\u00e9ndez and Darros-Barbosa, 2018).\nThe main methods of caffeine extraction are: 1) removal by chemical solvents: mainly ethyl acetate and diclomethane; 2) the triglyceride method; 3) removal of caffeine by carbon dioxide; 4) the system through a water extractor.\nDecaffeinated coffee exists in nature and comes from a plant called Coffea charrieriana. However, its use is not widespread due to the rarity of this plant. The use of decaffeinated coffee is controversial for two main reasons. The first is that many manufacturers use a chemical process to remove the caffeine from the coffee beans. The result is less caffeine, but more chemicals. Second, it is the caffeine in coffee that provides the health and energy benefits. Without it, there are few benefits other than maintaining the coffee ritual.\nThe role of oxidative stress and inflammation in the pathogenesis and complications of several chronic diseases, including cancer, diabetes, neurodegenerative disorders, and cardiovascular disease, is well established. The anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties of coffee have been investigated in numerous studies. There are more than 1000 chemical compounds in coffee. The compounds most known for their anti-inflammatory properties include caffeine, chlorogenic acid, trigonelline, melanoidins, caffeic acid, kahweol, and cafestol (Castaldo et al., 2021).\nInflammatory bowel disease cannot be controlled by diet alone. Certainly, some dietary indications can be very useful, especially during periods of disease activity. In particular, patients with ulcerative colitis often wonder whether coffee, one of the most popular drinks among Italians, should be strictly avoided. The answer is not unequivocal: at the moment, in fact, there is no certain evidence of the harmful effect of coffee and caffeine on the intestines of patients with this pathology, so no specific correlation has been found between the consumption of this drink and the progression of the disease (Campmans-Kuijpers and Dijkstra, 2021).\nMoreover, broad in vitro and in vivo studies have illustrated that coffee and its bioactive compounds show neuroprotective impacts suggesting their preventive and/or helpful potential for several neurodegenerative conditions (Di Meo et al., 2020; Ruggiero et al., 2022). Caffeine, in fact, lowers the risk of neurodegeneration in humans. In the short term, coffee may improve mood, alertness, learning and reaction time, and in the long term, it may protect against brain conditions such as Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s diseases. Alzheimer\u2019s disease causes memory loss, as well as cognitive and behavioural problems. Diet-related factors can influence the risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease and other forms of dementia. Observational studies have associated regular and moderate coffee consumption with up to a 65% lower risk of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease, although the correlation is still being studied in depth (Ruggiero et al., 2022).\nParkinson\u2019s disease is a chronic disease of the central nervous system. It is characterized by the death of nerve cells in the brain that secrete dopamine and are important for muscle movement. Parkinson\u2019s primarily affects movement and often includes tremors. Some studies show that coffee may help reduce the risk of Parkinson\u2019s disease, with a 29% lower risk of developing the disease (Ruggiero et al., 2022). The caffeine contained in coffee appears to be the active ingredient capable of exerting these protective effects. Despite this, it is well known that neuroprotective effect of coffee is not due to caffeine alone, but to other bioactive components, such as polyphenols, including phenolic acid, i.e., caffeic acid, ferulic acid, p-coumaric acid, chlorogenic acid, and quinin acid. These bioactive polyphenols are described to improve motor and cognitive performance both in aging and depression (Di Meo et al., 2020). In this respect, chlorogenic acid, a polyphenol derived from coffee determined neuroprotection against rotenone-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease by glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion (Sharma et al., 2022). Prospective studies are needed to gain further insight into the precise molecular mechanisms and signaling network implicated in the neuroprotective anti-inflammatory action of compounds present in coffee, other than caffeine, using in vivo models of Parkinson\u2019s disease as well as in the treatment of symptoms of Parkinson\u2019s disease in a clinical setting.\nIn addition, there is evidence that suggest that habitual coffee consumption can potentially have positive impact on the course of autoimmune diseases such as multiple sclerosis (Wasim et al., 2020).\nAmong coffee compounds, caffeine surely has been the most extensively investigated in terms of neuroprotective effects, but the beneficial effects of coffee consumption can attributable not only to caffeine. Aside from caffeine, as already above mentioned, there are several other compounds in coffee that may independently determine particularly interesting protective effects in neurodegenerative conditions consequently paying attention to the possible use of decaffeinated coffee as a preventive and neuroprotective treatment. In this respect, other that polyphenolic acids, which include cholinergic acids and caffeic acid, the compound known as trigonelline looks the most promising one in terms of neuroprotection both in Alzheimer\u2019s disease and in Parkinson\u2019s disease (Mirzaie et al., 2016; Fahanik-Babaei et al., 2019). Unfortunately, unlike caffeine, there are still no epidemiological or clinical studies on the protective value of the other coffee compounds in case of neurodegenerative disorders. Only preliminary data are present. For that reason, in-depth studies aimed at obtaining new information about the neuroprotective effect of coffee and its most promising bioactive compounds, represented by caffeine, coffee polyphenols, and trigonelline, are needed.\nTherefore, coffee consumption seems to be associated with a reduced risk of inflammatory diseases, whose mechanisms of action appear to be multidirectional. It should be noted that in many circumstances the beneficial effects associated with coffee intake are not always clear, as the same subjective inflammatory/oxidative profile can constitute a variable. The beneficial effects associated with coffee consumption are illustrated in Figure 1.\nAn interesting aspect of these studies is to provide information on possible nutraceutical treatments, assuming that the coffee constituents may have pharmacological effects, acting synergistically or antagonistically, used alone or in combination with other compounds to reduce drug intake and encourage the consumption of natural ingredients in adequate doses to promote health and fight disease by reducing unwanted risks and side effects of conventional drug therapies. Coffee is cheap and the favourite drink all over the world, thus the coffee consumption may provide a cost-effective and alluring preventive measure against chronic disease.\nFootnotes\nC-Editors: Zhao M, Liu WJ, Yu J; T-Editor: Jia Y\nReferences\n- 1.Campmans-Kuijpers MJE, Dijkstra G.

Coffee, tea, and milk are widely consumed beverages known to have potential health impacts. This study aimed to assess their immediate effects on visual parameters following extended laptop use.\nMethods: A prospective cohort study included twenty healthy adults aged 18 to 35. Ethical approval was obtained, and participants gave informed consent. Baseline visual assessments were conducted after three hours of laptop use. Participants consumed 100 mL of coffee, tea, or milk on three consecutive days, and visual metrics were evaluated at 30 minutes and 60 minutes post-consumption. Standardized optometric tests were employed, and the data were analysed using SPSS 21.0, including MANOVA and linear regression.\nResults: Twenty female participants (mean age: 20.6 years \u00b1 0.753) underwent visual assessments after consuming coffee, tea, and milk. After 30 minutes of coffee intake, contrast sensitivity increased from 1.60 to 1.75 logs (P = 0.026) but declined to 1.59 logs after 60 minutes (P = 0.016). Coffee notably affected near-point convergence with a red filter, decreasing from 10.40cm to 10.55cm at 30 minutes and to 10.78cm at 60 minutes (P = 0.000). Tea consumption showed a significant change in deutan color vision (P = 0.034) between 30 and 60 minutes, while no statistically significant alterations were observed for milk. Simple linear regression indicated no significant impact of beverages on visual parameters over time (p > 0.05).\nConclusion: This study delineates the transient effects of coffee and tea on visual parameters, showing temporary improvements in contrast sensitivity and colour vision within 30 minutes, subsiding after 60 minutes. Both coffee and tea induced a clinically significant increase in accommodation amplitude while causing a regression in near-point convergence, contrasting with milk consumption, which led to decreased visual parameters due to tryptophan's presence inducing drowsiness.\nIntroduction\nPractically all professional and recreational activities in the twenty-first century require the use of digital displays. The computer has evolved into a ubiquitous fixture in every household. An approximated 35 % of individuals consult their mobile devices prior to utilising provisions such as coffee, toothbrushes, or other necessities. An earlier study found that the mean daily time devoted to electronic display viewing is approximately 9.7 hours for adults and 7.5 hours for adolescents. [1] Extended periods of stationary posture can deplete an individual's energy, and the body may associate such stillness with the onset of slumber. Energy refreshments such as coffee, tea, milk, and others provide them with a revitalized sensation. Coffee and tea are beverages that are significantly consumed by adults on a global scale. Coffee is widely consumed, and the rate of consumption continues to rise. The bioactivity of coffee's complex chemical compounds is accountable for its invigorating and revitalizing properties. [2] Similarly, tea is the most widely consumed beverage in the globe, second only to water. Research has demonstrated that the cholinergic acids present in coffee beans, flavan-3-ols, complex theaflavins, and thearubigens found in tea leaves all have positive effects on health. To determine the diverse health advantages of these beverages, an examination was conducted on their abundant phenolic compound content. Caffeine, vitamins, minerals, polyphenols, and additional constituents found in coffee all contribute to its numerous health benefits. Tea is beneficial to consume due to the polyphenols, catechins and epicatechins, which are present in tea. [3]\nCoffee and tea consumption has been linked in multiple studies to a decreased risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke. [4, 5] The presence of polyphenols in coffee and tea aids in mitigating the risk associated with the above. A profusion of the antioxidant cholinergic acid enhances glucose metabolism, thereby impeding the production of advanced glycogen end products and, as a result, reducing the long-term risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Antioxidants found in tea assist the body in metabolizing glucose in the blood. [6] Caffeine may alleviate the initial symptoms of Parkinson's disease, according to some studies, while coffee and tea consumption may provide some protection against the disease, according to others. [7]\nA previous study found a direct relationship between increased coffee intake and elevated intraocular pressure.[8] Nevertheless, the impact of coffee and tea on additional visual parameters is not yet understood. Therefore, the objective of this research was to determine the immediate impact of coffee, tea, and milk on various visual parameters, including contrast sensitivity, convergence, accommodation, and visual acuity, subsequent to extended periods of laptop usage. It was hypothesized that, as stimulants, coffee and tea would enhance performance in all visual parameters, whereas milk would diminish it.\nMethodology\nThe purpose of this study was to investigate the potential impact of beverage consumption on several visual metrics following prolonged laptop usage among a group of twenty healthy adults ranging in age from 18 to 35. The study was designed as a prospective cohort study. A simple random sampling approach was utilized in order to pick the participants for the study. This was done in order to guarantee that the cohort was represented in an objective manner. For the purpose of ensuring ethical compliance and upholding the ethical standards that were set in the Declaration of Helsinki, the protocol for the study was given formal approval by the institutional ethics committee that is in charge of reviewing research involving human subjects. It was ensured that every participant gave their written informed consent, confirming that they participated voluntarily and that they were aware of the objectives and procedures of the study. In addition, before the beginning of the examination, participants were given a detailed description of the examination protocol to guarantee that they were aware of every detail and gave their agreement after being sufficiently informed. Taking into consideration the potential influence that prolonged screen exposure during this time period could have on visual health, the evaluations of visual parameters were planned to take place throughout the evening hours. This was done in order to imitate a common scenario of prolonged laptop usage. Visual acuity, convergence, accommodation, contrast sensitivity, and colour vision were some of the elements that were included in these criteria. These comprised a wide variety of variables that impact visual function.\nA minimum of three hours of laptop use was required of each participant before the execution of the visual assessments. After the subjects had been using their laptops for a lengthy amount of time, they were subjected to routine optometric tests in order to evaluate their visual acuity, convergence, accommodation, colour vision, and contrast sensitivity. The tests were designed to correctly capture the baseline readings, taking into account the typical changes in visual performance that occur throughout the day, particularly after prolonged exposure to a screen.\nTo evaluate the impact that various beverages have on visual metrics, the researchers utilized a novel methodology. The participants were given 100 millilitres of three different beverages\u2014milk, coffee, and tea\u2014on three successive days that were consecutive to one another. The purpose of this research was to investigate the possibility of alterations in visual metrics following the ingestion of numerous beverages. To establish a comparison reference point, baseline readings were acquired before the consumption of beverages. Following the consumption of beverages, the subsequent evaluations of visual parameters were carried out at two distinct time intervals: thirty minutes and one hour. Using this strategic approach, we were able to investigate any immediate or short-term effects that the beverages that were ingested had on visual performance indicators after prolonged laptop use. This allowed us to examine temporal effects. The precise approaches that were utilized to evaluate visual parameters were standardized and performed in accordance with the protocols that have been developed in the field of optometry. To determine contrast sensitivity, the Freiburg visual acuity test, [9] often known as FrACT, was utilized. [10] To locate the near point of accommodation (NPA), the push-up method was utilized in conjunction with an RAF ruler. [11] Finding the near point of convergence (NPC) was accomplished through the use of the penlight method. [12] With regard to the evaluation of visual acuity, the log MAR chart was utilized. Additionally, a standardized colour-blind test was utilized to evaluate the subject's colour vision.\nAfter carefully gathering all of the information, it was then entered into Microsoft Excel in a methodical manner so that it could be organized in a systematic manner and then analysed. A statistical analysis was carried out with the assistance of the SPSS 21.0 program. The data were subjected to conventional analysis techniques to verify that they followed a normal distribution before any additional analysis was carried out.\nThe subsequent analysis of the data consisted of a number of processes, one of which was descriptive statistical analysis, which was used to determine the variances and means in visual parameters that occurred after the ingestion of various beverages, respectively. The multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) was employed to compare the means of the three beverages with regard to particular visual criteria. In addition, a simple linear regression analysis was carried out to investigate and quantify the potential temporal impacts that various beverages could have on the range of visual metrics that were assessed.\nResults:\nTwenty female participants were included in the study. The average age of the study cohort was 20.6 years \u00b1 0.753. Baseline readings for coffee, tea, and milk consumers were collected at approximately 7.34 p.m., 9.30 p.m., and 9.51 p.m., respectively. Table 1 illustrates the mean values of various visual parameters at baseline and 30 minutes post-consumption of coffee, tea, and milk.\nA statistically significant increase in contrast sensitivity was seen from 1.60 logs at the start to 1.75 logs after 30 minutes of coffee consumption (P = 0.026; 95% CI 0.018\u20130.27) by Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA). However, there was a noteworthy decline in contrast sensitivity from 1.75 logs at the 30-minute mark to 1.59 logs after 60 minutes (P = 0.016; 95% CI 0.03\u20130.028). This trend is illustrated in Figure 1A, which depicts an initial increase in contrast sensitivity following thirty minutes of coffee intake, subsequently returning to levels akin to the baseline after sixty minutes. A clear decrease in the ability to recover near-point of convergence (NPC) was observed while using the red filter after consuming coffee. There was a significant decrease from the initial measurement (10.40cm) to the measurement taken after 30 minutes (10.55cm) (P = 0.000, 95% CI 1.83\u20133.87). Furthermore, a significant drop in measurement was noticed after consuming coffee, namely from the 30-minute mark (10.55cm) to the measurement taken after 60 minutes (10.78cm) (P = 0.000, 95% CI 2.21\u20134.25). The values closely approximated the initial readings and are visually represented in Figure 1B. Table 2 presents the important factors associated with coffee intake within the 30- and 60-minute periods after the initial measurement. Although there were changes in other variables after drinking a beverage for 30 and 60 minutes, these changes were not statistically significant.\nA Multivariate Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) was performed to examine the average differences in coffee, tea, and milk intake between baseline and 30 minutes, 30 minutes and 60 minutes, and baseline and 60 minutes, respectively. The results from Figures 2A and 2B indicate a significant difference in NPC with red filter recovery between the start and 30 minutes (P = 0.000, 95% CI 2.22\u20133.79) and between the start and 60 minutes (95% CI 2.12\u20133.69) after consuming coffee. However, there were no substantial changes observed in the use of either tea or milk.\nBy examining the \"mean difference\" in tea consumption at different time intervals (baseline to 30 minutes, 30 minutes to 60 minutes, and baseline to 60 minutes), a significant change in colour vision deutan (P = 0.034, 95% CI 0.06\u20131.44) during the 30-to-60-minute period with tea consumption was observed. However, there was no noticeable alteration in the intake of coffee and milk, as depicted in figures 3A and 3B. Table 3 presents the important factors linked to the consumption of coffee and tea within the 30 and 60-minute periods from the initial measurement. No statistically significant alterations were seen in visual acuity, near point of accommodation (NPA), or NPC break between the baseline and 60-minute mean values. Applying simple linear regression to assess the influence of each beverage on the starting state, as well as the 30th and 60th minutes following intake, indicated that none of the beverages had a statistically significant impact (p > 0.05).\nDiscussion:\nThis study aimed to explore diverse visual characteristics and the effects of three distinct beverages following prolonged laptop use, given previous indications that extended laptop exposure may induce visual fatigue. [11] Despite assessing various aspects such as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, colour vision, accommodation, and convergence, statistically significant differences were primarily observed in contrast sensitivity, convergence recovery using a red filter, and colour vision specifically related to the deutan subtype. Subsequent to consuming coffee for both 30 and 60 minutes, there was a significant alteration in contrast sensitivity (1.60, 1.75, and 1.59) with P-values of 0.026 and 0.016. Similarly, convergence recovery using a red filter (10.40, 10.55, and 10.78) demonstrated substantial significance after 30 and 60 minutes of coffee intake, reporting a P-value of 0.000. In comparison to milk or coffee intake, there was a notable difference in the mid-range of colour vision, specifically in the deutan subtype (1.05, 0.43, and 0.43) (P = 0.034). Notably, earlier studies found that the wavelength of tea pigments that stimulated deutan subtype colour vision was 514.5 nm at room temperature. [12] This matches up with more recent research that showed drinking tea significantly improved deutan-subtype colour vision compared to drinking coffee or milk. When comparing the consumption of tea to coffee or milk, it was observed that the initial deutan and tritan values (2.15, 1.50, and 1.30) significantly rose after consuming tea. While the consumption of coffee (2.0, 2.05, and 1.83) and milk (1.23, 1.18, and 0.98) resulted in an enhancement of the Tritan value, there was no statistically significant alteration seen. Following one hour of consumption, the deutan value exhibited an increase in the presence of coffee; yet, it experienced a further reduction in the presence of milk. Similarly, the baseline contrast sensitivity levels were lower compared to the levels observed after consuming coffee and tea. On the other hand, the baseline values were initially better but decreased after consuming milk. Following a 30-minute period of consuming coffee, there was a noticeable enhancement in contrast acuity. However, after one hour, the measurements had reverted back to their initial levels, suggesting that the benefit was just temporary.\nThe primary elements that influence contrast sensitivity are spatial brightness, texture, movement, colour, and binocular disparity. [13] Previous studies have indicated that the modest neurostimulant effects caused by usual dietary quantities of coffee alter the release of dopamine. [14] This phenomenon was discovered to suppress neuronal activity across the whole brain. [15] The diurnal characteristics of vision under conditions of light adaptation and the ability to perceive contrast are contingent upon the presence of dopamine. [16] These ideas elucidate the transient enhancement in contrast acuity that ensues following coffee consumption. Prior studies conducted by Jeff C. Rabin et al. shown a notable enhancement in eyesight and contrast sensitivity when individuals consumed dark chocolate as opposed to milk chocolate. [17] The present study compared the effects of coffee and tea, both of which contain caffeine like dark chocolate. It observed an enhancement in contrast sensitivity but no alteration in visual acuity. These results partially align with the previous study on contrast sensitivity but contradict the findings on visual acuity. This discrepancy may be attributed to the varying caffeine levels in each beverage.\nFollowing tea consumption, there was a noteworthy rise in the amplitude of accommodation by 0.30 D after 30 minutes, which further rose by 0.12 D after an hour, resulting in a total increase of 0.42 D. After ingesting coffee, the amplitude of accommodation increased by 0.17 D. However, after 60 minutes, it reduced by 0.24 D, resulting in an overall decrease of 0.07 D. None of the drinks exhibited a statistically significant difference. However, following a 30-minute consumption of milk, there was a decrease of 0.22 diopters (D), which only slightly improved by 0.09 D after 60 minutes. Overall, there was a loss of 0.13 D, as illustrated in figure 4.\nAnother study examining the \"Impact of coffee (caffeine) on the prevention of human cataract blindness\" discovered that persons who consumed a higher quantity of coffee had a reduced occurrence of the condition compared to those who consumed less. [18] This indicates a correlation between the consumption of caffeine and changes in the lens of the eye in people. The current study also discovered a significant increase in accommodation among coffee and tea drinkers compared to milk drinkers; supporting the claim that caffeine intake influences lenticular change.\nThe beverages had a negative effect on convergence, as seen by a decrease in the near-points of convergence across all three groups. A significant decrease in NPC was observed with coffee drinking, as evidenced by a statistically significant drop (P = 0.000) in NPC measurements. Specifically, there was a decrease in NPC from baseline (10.40cm) to 30 minutes post-consumption (10.55cm), as well as from 30 minutes post-consumption (10.55cm) to 60 minutes post-consumption (10.78cm). Although there was no statistical significance, a noticeable and meaningful decrease in convergence was observed with the red filter after consuming tea, with a reduction of 0.72 cm at the breakpoint and 0.63 cm at the recovery point. Although milk consumption led to a decrease in NPC, the decline was neither clinically or statistically significant.\nTea primarily contains two key components: caffeine and L-theanine. [19] An electroencephalogram (EEG) showed that consuming L-theanine reduced activity in the sympathetic nervous system. [20] Altering the levels of dopamine and serotonin in the brain induces a calming effect and reduces the activity of the sympathetic nervous system, leading to a state of relaxation and heightened awareness. [21] The sympathetic nervous system's impact, which encourages ciliary muscle tonicity while stimulating pupil dilation, explains the increased amplitude of accommodation following tea consumption. [22] While coffee consumption led to an increase in the amplitude of accommodation, the rise was greater when consuming tea. The reduction of impulses transmitted through the short ciliary nerves, which connect the post-ciliary ganglia to the oculomotor neurons, leads to pupil dilation. This, in turn, causes a decrease in the contraction of the medial rectus muscle and ultimately affects the near point of convergence. [23]\nAfter consuming milk, all visual measurements that were shown to be significantly improved or diminished by coffee and tea consistently declined. Tryptophan, an amino acid included in milk, is believed to play a role in the synthesis of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that aids in sleep promotion and attention reduction. [24] The current study excluded the measurement of intraocular pressure (IOP) as one of the variables to be examined due to the existence of several studies exploring the relationship between coffee drinking and alterations in IOP. [8, 25-27] All of these previous trials incorporated either coffee or other drugs containing caffeine. Tea was excluded from the study; therefore, it is imperative to investigate the impact of tea on IOP levels. The study's constraints include the potential for a more comprehensive understanding of beverage effects on visual metrics with a larger sample size. Furthermore, the study did not evaluate tear film changes, corneal curvature modifications, axial length fluctuations, and other pertinent parameters that could exhibit significant alterations with each beverage, particularly following extended laptop use.\nConclusion:\nThis study delineates the transient effects of coffee and tea on visual parameters, showing temporary improvements in contrast sensitivity and colour vision within 30 minutes, subsiding after 60 minutes. Both coffee and tea induced a clinically significant increase in accommodation amplitude while causing a regression in near-point convergence, contrasting with milk consumption, which led to decreased visual parameters due to tryptophan's presence inducing drowsiness.\nAcknowledgement: Authors would like to acknowledge Dr.Sajeev Cherian Jacob, Principal of Ahalia School of Optometry for providing the logistics support for data collection.\nFunding: This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.\nConflict of interest: None\nReferences\n- Rosenfield M.

Consumption was measured using a custom scale consisting of \u201ccaffeine units\u201d, described below.\n\nPress enter or click to view image in full size\n\nImage 4\n\n### Caffeine Units [...] I started tracking my caffeine intake in late September and still do so. I have known for a while that my body metabolizes caffeine differently than the average person \u2014 I am highly sensitive to this molecule. I wanted to get a better idea of how caffeine might affect other patterns in my life, especially anxiety, irritability, and sleep, which I also track.

Coffee has several constituents able to impact on human health, amongst which stems caffeine, which is the most widely consumed psychostimulant in the world . Despite its widespread use it is surprising to note that a thorough characterization [...] ### MRI brain imaging",
