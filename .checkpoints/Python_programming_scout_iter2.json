It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python\u2019s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.\nThe Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python website, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.\nThe Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.\nThis tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. Be aware that it expects you to have a basic understanding of programming in general. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.\nFor a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering Python in depth.\nThis tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python\u2019s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language\u2019s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library.\nThe Glossary is also worth going through.\n- 1.

      "content": "Python is a versatile, high-level programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Python offers a wide range of functionalities that make it a popular choice in various domains such as web development, data science, artificial intelligence, and more. In this article, we'll cover the foundational concepts of Python programming to help you get started.\nWriting First Python Program\nTo begin coding in Python, we'll need to have Python installed on our system. You can download the latest version from the official Python website. Once installed, we can write and execute Python code using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like PyCharm, Vs Code (requires installing Python extension), or even a simple text editor.\nPython\nprint(\"Hello Geeks, Welcome to Python Basics\")\nOutputHello Geeks, Welcome to Python Basics\nExplanation: print() is a built-in function that outputs text or variables to the console. In this case, it displays the string \"Hello, Geeks! Welcome to Python Basics\".\nComments in Python\nComments in Python are the lines in the code that are ignored by the interpreter during the execution of the program. Also, Comments enhance the readability of the code and help the programmers to understand the code very carefully.\nPython\n# This is a single-line comment\n\"\"\"\nThis is a\nmulti-line comment\nor docstring.\n\"\"\"\nExplanation:\n- #: Denotes a single-line comment.\n- \"\"\" \"\"\" or ''' ''': Triple quotes are used for multi-line comments or docstrings.\nVariables in Python\nPython Variable is a container that store values. Python is not \u201cstatically typed\u201d. An Example of a Variable in Python is a representational name that serves as a pointer to an object. Once an object is assigned to a variable, it can be referred to by that name.\nRules for Naming Variables\n- Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).\n- Cannot start with a number.\n- Can only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores.\n- Case-sensitive (name, Name, and NAME are different variables).\n- The reserved words(keywords) in Python cannot be used to name the variable in Python.\nExample:\nPython\n# Integer assignment\nage = 45\n# Floating-point assignment\nsalary = 1456.8\n# String assignment\nname = \"Geek\"\nprint(age)\nprint(salary)\nprint(name)\nData Types in Python\nData types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes and variables are instances (objects) of these classes.\nExample: This code assigns variable \u2018x\u2019 different values of various data types in Python.\nPython\nx = \"Hello World\" # string\nx = 50 # integer\nx = 60.5 # float\nx = 3j # complex\nx = [\"geeks\", \"for\", \"geeks\"] # list\nx = (\"geeks\", \"for\", \"geeks\") # tuple\nx = {\"name\": \"Suraj\", \"age\": 24} # dict\nx = {\"geeks\", \"for\", \"geeks\"} # set\nx = True # bool\nx = b\"Geeks\" # binary\nPython provides simple functions for input and output operations.\nInput\nThe input() function allows user input, example:\nPython\nval = input(\"Enter your value: \")\nprint(\"You entered:\", val)\nOutput:\nEnter your value: 11\nYou entered: 11\nThe input() function in Python always returns data as a string, regardless of what the user enters. If we want to store the input as another data type (like int, float, etc.), we need to explicitly convert (typecast) it.\nExample:\nPython\nname = input(\"Enter your name: \")\nprint(type(name))\nage = int(input(\"Enter your age: \"))\nprint(type(age))\nOutput:\nEnter your name: Geeks\n<class 'str'>\nEnter your age: 8\n<class 'int'>\nExplanation:\n- name stores the input as a string (default behavior of input()).\n- age stores the input as an integer using int() for typecasting.\nPython\n# Python program show input and Output\nval = input(\"Enter your value: \")\nprint(val)\nPython Operators\nIn Python programming, Operators in general are used to perform operations on values and variables. These are standard symbols used for the purpose of logical and arithmetic operations. In this article, we will look into different types of Python operators.\nArithmetic Operators\nPython Arithmetic operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Types of arithmetic operators: +, -, *, /, //, %, **\nPrecedence of Arithmetic Operators\nThe precedence of Arithmetic Operators in Python is as follows:\n- P \u2013 Parentheses\n- E \u2013 Exponentiation\n- M \u2013 Multiplication (Multiplication and division have the same precedence)\n- D \u2013 Division\n- A \u2013 Addition (Addition and subtraction have the same precedence)\n- S \u2013 Subtraction\nExample:\nPython\na = 9\nb = 4\nadd = a + b\nsub = a - b\nmul = a * b\nmod = a % b\nE = a ** b\nprint(add)\nprint(sub)\nprint(mul)\nprint(mod)\nprint(E)\nComparison Operators\nComparison operators are used to compare two values. They return a Boolean value \u2014 either True or False \u2014 depending on whether the comparison is correct. These operators are often used in conditional statements like if, while, and loops.\nExample:\nPython\na = 10\nb = 20\nprint(a == b) # False, because 10 is not equal to 20\nprint(a != b) # True, because 10 is not equal to 20\nprint(a > b) # False, 10 is not greater than 20\nprint(a < b) # True, 10 is less than 20\nprint(a >= b) # False, 10 is not greater than or equal to 20\nprint(a <= b) # True, 10 is less than or equal to 20\nOutputFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nFalse\nTrue\nExplanation:\n- Each print() checks a condition.\n- The result is either True or False depending on whether the comparison holds.\n- These operators are commonly used to control program flow in if statements, loops, etc.\nLogical Operators\nPython Logical operators perform Logical AND , Logical OR , and Logical NOT operations. It is used to combine conditional statements. Types of logicsl operators: and, or, not.\nPython\na = True\nb = False\nprint(a and b)\nprint(a or b)\nprint(not a)\nBitwise Operators\nPython Bitwise operators act on bits and perform bit-by-bit operations. These are used to operate on binary numbers. Types of bitwise operators: &, |, ^, ~, <<, >>\nPython\na = 10\nb = 4\nprint(a & b)\nprint(a | b)\nprint(~a)\nprint(a ^ b)\nprint(a >> 2)\nprint(a << 2)\nAssignment Operators\nPython Assignment operators are used to assign values to the variables. Types of assignment operators: =, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, **=, //=, &=, |=, ^=, >>=, <<=.\nPython\na = 10\nb = a\nprint(b)\nb += a\nprint(b)\nb -= a\nprint(b)\nb *= a\nprint(b)\nb <<= a\nprint(b)\nOutput10\n20\n10\n100\n102400\nPython If Else\nIn Python, the if statement is used to run a block of code only when a specific condition is true. If the condition is false and you want to run a different block of code, you can use the else statement. This allows your program to make decisions and respond differently based on conditions.\nExample 1: Python IF-Else\nPython\ni = 20\nif (i < 15):\nprint(\"i is smaller than 15\")\nprint(\"i'm in if Block\")\nelse:\nprint(\"i is greater than 15\")\nprint(\"i'm in else Block\")\nprint(\"i'm not in if and not in else Block\")\nOutputi is greater than 15\ni'm in else Block\ni'm not in if and not in else Block\nExplanation:\n- The condition i < 15 is False, so the else block is executed.\n- The last print() runs no matter what because it's outside the if-else structure.\nExample 2: Python if-elif-else ladder\nSometimes, weneed to check multiple conditions. In such cases, Python provides the if-elif-else structure.\nPython\ni = 20\nif (i == 10):\nprint(\"i is 10\")\nelif (i == 15):\nprint(\"i is 15\")\nelif (i == 20):\nprint(\"i is 20\")\nelse:\nprint(\"i is not present\")\nExplanation:\n- Python checks conditions from top to bottom.\n- Once a condition is True, it executes that block and skips the rest.\n- If none of the conditions match, it executes the else block.\nPython Loops\nFor Loop\nPython For loop is used for sequential traversal i.e. it is used for iterating over an iterable like String, Tuple, List, Set, or Dictionary. Here, we will see a \"for\" loop in conjunction with the range() function to generate a sequence of numbers starting from 0, up to (but not including) 10, and with a step size of 2. For each number in the sequence, the loop prints its value using the print() function.\nPython\nfor i in range(0, 10, 2):\nprint(i)\nExplanation:\n- range(0, 10, 2) generates numbers: 0, 2, 4, 6, 8.\n- The loop prints each number on a new line.\nWhile Loop\nA while loop continues to execute as long as a condition is True. In this example, the condition for while will be True as long as the counter variable (count) is less than 3.\nPython\ncount = 0\nwhile (count < 3):\ncount = count + 1\nprint(\"Hello Geek\")\nOutputHello Geek\nHello Geek\nHello Geek\nExplanation:\n- The loop runs 3 times because count goes from 0 - 1 - 2.\n- Once count becomes 3, the condition count < 3 becomes False and the loop stops.\nAlso see: Use of break, continue and pass in Python\nPython Functions\nPython Function is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. Functions help make your code modular, readable, and easier to debug.\nThere are two main types of functions in Python:\n- Built-in functions like print(), len(), type()\n- User-defined functions created using the def keyword\nExample: User-Defined Function to Check Even/Odd\nPython\ndef evenOdd(x):\nif x % 2 == 0:\nprint(\"even\")\nelse:\nprint(\"odd\")\nevenOdd(2)\nevenOdd(3)\nExplanation:\n- The function evenOdd(x) checks if x is divisible by 2.\n- If it is, it prints \"even\"; otherwise, \"odd\".\nWhat's Next\nAfter understanding the Python Basics, there are several paths you can explore to further enhance your skills and delve deeper into the language:\n- Continuous Python Learning : This article offers a well-organized, in-depth tutorial on Python, guiding learners from the basics to more advanced topics.\n- Advanced Python Concepts : This article covers some advance Python concepts that distinguishes Python from any other language such as list comprehenison, lambda function, etc.\n- Python Packages and Frameworks : Python has a rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks for a wide range of tasks such as web development with frameworks like Django or Flask, data analysis and visualization with libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib, machine learning and artificial intelligence with TensorFlow or PyTorch, or automation with libraries like Selenium or BeautifulSoup This article explores them in detail.\n- Build Python Projects : Learn how to build real-world applications using Python.

Beginning with Python 3.5,[35] capabilities and keywords for typing were added to the language, allowing optional static typing.[36] As of 2025[update], the Python Software Foundation supports Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14, following the projects annual release cycle and five-year support policy. Earlier versions in the 3.x series have reached end-of-life and no longer receive security updates.\nPython has gained widespread use in the machine learning community.[37][38][39][40] It is widely taught as an introductory programming language.[41] Since 2003, Python has consistently ranked in the top ten of the most popular programming languages in the TIOBE Programming Community Index, which ranks based on searches in 24 platforms.[42]\nHistory\nPython was conceived in the late 1980s[43] by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands.[44] It was designed as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL,[45] capable of exception handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system.[13] Python implementation began in December 1989.[44] Van Rossum first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[44] Van Rossum assumed sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he announced his \"permanent vacation\" from responsibilities as Python's \"benevolent dictator for life\" (BDFL); this title was bestowed on him by the Python community to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.[46] (He has since come out of retirement and is self-titled \"BDFL-emeritus\".) In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead the project.[47][48]\nThe name Python derives from the British comedy series Monty Python's Flying Circus.[49] (See \u00a7 Naming.)\nPython 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, featuring many new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support.[50] Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, and then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3.[51][52] It no longer receives security patches or updates.[53][54] While Python 2.7 and older versions are officially unsupported, a different unofficial Python implementation, PyPy, continues to support Python 2, i.e., \"2.7.18+\" (plus 3.11), with the plus signifying (at least some) \"backported security updates\".[55]\nPython 3.0 was released on 3 December 2008, and was a major revision and not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions, with some new semantics and changed syntax. Python 2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[56] Several releases in the Python 3.x series have added new syntax to the language, and made a few (considered very minor) backward-incompatible changes.\nAs of December 2025[update], Python 3.14.2 is the latest stable release. All older 3.x versions had a security update down to Python 3.9.24 then again with 3.9.25, the final version in 3.9 series. Python 3.10 is, since November 2025, the oldest supported branch.[57] Python 3.15 has an alpha released, and Android has an official downloadable executable available for Python 3.14. Releases receive two years of full support followed by three years of security support.\nDesign philosophy and features\nPython is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming \u2013 including metaprogramming[58] and metaobjects.[59] Many other paradigms are supported via extensions, including design by contract[60][61] and logic programming.[62] Python is often referred to as a 'glue language'[63] because it is purposely designed to be able to integrate components written in other languages.\nPython uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector for memory management.[64] It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names during program execution.\nPython's design offers some support for functional programming in the \"Lisp tradition\". It has filter\n, map\n, and reduce\nfunctions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.[65] The standard library has two modules (itertools\nand functools\n) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.[66]\nPython's core philosophy is summarized in the Zen of Python (PEP 20) written by Tim Peters, which includes aphorisms such as these:[67]\n- Explicit is better than implicit.\n- Simple is better than complex.\n- Readability counts.\n- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.\n- Although practicality beats purity.\n- Errors should never pass silently.\n- Unless explicitly silenced.\n- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.\nHowever, Python has received criticism for violating these principles and adding unnecessary language bloat.[68] Responses to these criticisms note that the Zen of Python is a guideline rather than a rule.[69] The addition of some new features had been controversial: Guido van Rossum resigned as Benevolent Dictator for Life after conflict about adding the assignment expression operator in Python 3.8.[70][71]\nNevertheless, rather than building all functionality into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible via modules. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications. Van Rossum's vision of a small core language with a large standard library and easily extensible interpreter stemmed from his frustrations with ABC, which represented the opposite approach.[43]\nPython claims to strive for a simpler, less-cluttered syntax and grammar, while giving developers a choice in their coding methodology. Python lacks do while loops, which Rossum considered harmful.[72] In contrast to Perl's motto \"there is more than one way to do it\", Python advocates an approach where \"there should be one \u2013 and preferably only one \u2013 obvious way to do it\".[67] In practice, however, Python provides many ways to achieve a given goal. There are at least three ways to format a string literal, with no certainty as to which one a programmer should use.[73] Alex Martelli is a Fellow at the Python Software Foundation and Python book author; he wrote that \"To describe something as 'clever' is not considered a compliment in the Python culture.\"[74]\nPython's developers typically prioritise readability over performance. For example, they reject patches to non-critical parts of the CPython reference implementation that would offer increases in speed that do not justify the cost of clarity and readability.[75][failed verification] Execution speed can be improved by moving speed-critical functions to extension modules written in languages such as C, or by using a just-in-time compiler like PyPy. Also, it is possible to transpile to other languages. However, this approach either fails to achieve the expected speed-up, since Python is a very dynamic language, or only a restricted subset of Python is compiled (with potential minor semantic changes).[76]\nPython is meant to be a fun language to use. This goal is reflected in the name \u2013 a tribute to the British comedy group Monty Python[77] \u2013 and in playful approaches to some tutorials and reference materials. For instance, some code examples use the terms \"spam\" and \"eggs\" (in reference to a Monty Python sketch), rather than the typical terms \"foo\" and \"bar\".[78][79]\nA common neologism in the Python community is pythonic, which has a broad range of meanings related to program style: Pythonic code may use Python idioms well; be natural or show fluency in the language; or conform with Python's minimalist philosophy and emphasis on readability.[80]\nSyntax and semantics\nPython is meant to be an easily readable language. Its formatting is visually uncluttered and often uses English keywords where other languages use punctuation. Unlike many other languages, it does not use curly brackets to delimit blocks, and semicolons after statements are allowed but rarely used. It has fewer syntactic exceptions and special cases than C or Pascal.[81]\nIndentation\nPython uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets or keywords, to delimit blocks. An increase in indentation comes after certain statements; a decrease in indentation signifies the end of the current block.[82] Thus, the program's visual structure accurately represents its semantic structure.[83] This feature is sometimes termed the off-side rule. Some other languages use indentation this way; but in most, indentation has no semantic meaning. The recommended indent size is four spaces.[84]\nStatements and control flow\nPython's statements include the following:\n- The assignment statement, using a single equals sign\n=\n- The\nif\nstatement, which conditionally executes a block of code, along withelse\nandelif\n(a contraction ofelse if\n) - The\nfor\nstatement, which iterates over an iterable object, capturing each element to a variable for use by the attached block; the variable is not deleted when the loop finishes - The\nwhile\nstatement, which executes a block of code as long as boolean condition is true - The\ntry\nstatement, which allows exceptions raised in its attached code block to be caught and handled byexcept\nclauses (or new syntaxexcept*\nin Python 3.11 for exception groups);[85] thetry\nstatement also ensures that clean-up code in afinally\nblock is always run regardless of how the block exits - The\nraise\nstatement, used to raise a specified exception or re-raise a caught exception - The\nclass\nstatement, which executes a block of code and attaches its local namespace to a class, for use in object-oriented programming - The\ndef\nstatement, which defines a function or method - The\nwith\nstatement, which encloses a code block within a context manager, allowing resource-acquisition-is-initialization (RAII)-like behavior and replacing a common try/finally idiom[86] Examples of a context include acquiring a lock before some code is run, and then releasing the lock; or opening and then closing a file - The\nbreak\nstatement, which exits a loop - The\ncontinue\nstatement, which skips the rest of the current iteration and continues with the next - The\ndel\nstatement, which removes a variable\u2014deleting the reference from the name to the value, and producing an error if the variable is referred to before it is redefined [c] - The\npass\nstatement, serving as a NOP (i.e., no operation), which is syntactically needed to create an empty code block - The\nassert\nstatement, used in debugging to check for conditions that should apply - The\nyield\nstatement, which returns a value from a generator function (and also an operator); used to implement coroutines - The\nreturn\nstatement, used to return a value from a function - The\nimport\nandfrom\nstatements, used to import modules whose functions or variables can be used in the current program - The\nmatch\nandcase\nstatements, analogous to a switch statement construct, which compares an expression against one or more cases as a control-flow measure\nThe assignment statement (=\n) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically allocated object. Variables may subsequently be rebound at any time to any object. In Python, a variable name is a generic reference holder without a fixed data type; however, it always refers to some object with a type. This is called dynamic typing\u2014in contrast to statically-typed languages, where each variable may contain only a value of a certain type.\nPython does not support tail call optimization or first-class continuations; according to Van Rossum, the language never will.[87][88] However, better support for coroutine-like functionality is provided by extending Python's generators.[89] Before 2.5, generators were lazy iterators; data was passed unidirectionally out of the generator. From Python 2.5 on, it is possible to pass data back into a generator function; and from version 3.3, data can be passed through multiple stack levels.[90]\nExpressions\nPython's expressions include the following:\n- The\n+\n,-\n, and*\noperators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behavior of division differs. There are two types of division in Python: floor division (or integer division)//\n, and floating-point division/\n.[91] Python uses the**\noperator for exponentiation. - Python uses the\n+\noperator for string concatenation. The language uses the*\noperator for duplicating a string a specified number of times. - The\n@\ninfix operator is intended to be used by libraries such as NumPy for matrix multiplication.[92][93] - The syntax\n:=\n, called the \"walrus operator\", was introduced in Python 3.8. This operator assigns values to variables as part of a larger expression.[94] - In Python,\n==\ncompares two objects by value. Python'sis\noperator may be used to compare object identities (i.e., comparison by reference), and comparisons may be chained\u2014for example,a <= b <= c\n. - Python uses\nand\n,or\n, andnot\nas Boolean operators. - Python has a type of expression called a list comprehension, and a more general expression called a generator expression.[65]\n- Anonymous functions are implemented using lambda expressions; however, there may be only one expression in each body.\n- Conditional expressions are written as\nx if c else y\n.[95] (This is different in operand order from thec ? x : y\noperator common to many other languages.) - Python makes a distinction between lists and tuples. Lists are written as\n[1, 2, 3]\n, are mutable, and cannot be used as the keys of dictionaries (since dictionary keys must be immutable in Python). Tuples, written as(1, 2, 3)\n, are immutable and thus can be used as the keys of dictionaries, provided that all of the tuple's elements are immutable. The+\noperator can be used to concatenate two tuples, which does not directly modify their contents, but produces a new tuple containing the elements of both. For example, given the variablet\ninitially equal to(1, 2, 3)\n, executingt = t + (4, 5)\nfirst evaluatest + (4, 5)\n, which yields(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n; this result is then assigned back tot\n\u2014thereby effectively \"modifying the contents\" oft\nwhile conforming to the immutable nature of tuple objects. Parentheses are optional for tuples in unambiguous contexts.[96] - Python features sequence unpacking where multiple expressions, each evaluating to something assignable (e.g., a variable or a writable property) are associated just as in forming tuple literal; as a whole, the results are then put on the left-hand side of the equal sign in an assignment statement. This statement expects an iterable object on the right-hand side of the equal sign to produce the same number of values as the writable expressions on the left-hand side; while iterating, the statement assigns each of the values produced on the right to the corresponding expression on the left.[97]\n- Python has a \"string format\" operator\n%\nthat functions analogously toprintf\nformat strings in the C language\u2014e.g.\"spam=%s eggs=%d\" % (\"blah\", 2)\nevaluates to\"spam=blah eggs=2\"\n. In Python 2.6+ and 3+, this operator was supplemented by theformat()\nmethod of thestr\nclass, e.g.,\"spam={0} eggs={1}\".format(\"blah\", 2)\n. Python 3.6 added \"f-strings\":spam = \"blah\"; eggs = 2; f'spam={spam} eggs={eggs}'\n.[98] - Strings in Python can be concatenated by \"adding\" them (using the same operator as for adding integers and floats); e.g.,\n\"spam\" + \"eggs\"\nreturns\"spameggs\"\n. If strings contain numbers, they are concatenated as strings rather than as integers, e.g.\"2\" + \"2\"\nreturns\"22\"\n. - Python supports string literals in several ways:\n- Delimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\n\\\n) as an escape character. String interpolation became available in Python 3.6 as \"formatted string literals\".[98] - Triple-quoted, i.e., starting and ending with three single or double quotation marks; this may span multiple lines and function like here documents in shells, Perl, and Ruby.\n- Raw string varieties, denoted by prefixing the string literal with\nr\n. Escape sequences are not interpreted; hence raw strings are useful where literal backslashes are common, such as in regular expressions and Windows-style paths. (Compare \"@\n-quoting\" in C#.)\n- Delimited by single or double quotation marks; single and double quotation marks have equivalent functionality (unlike in Unix shells, Perl, and Perl-influenced languages). Both marks use the backslash (\n- Python has array index and array slicing expressions in lists, which are written as\na[key]\n,a[start:stop]\nora[start:stop:step]\n. Indexes are zero-based, and negative indexes are relative to the end. Slices take elements from the start index up to, but not including, the stop index. The (optional) third slice parameter, called step or stride, allows elements to be skipped or reversed. Slice indexes may be omitted\u2014for example,a[:]\nreturns a copy of the entire list. Each element of a slice is a shallow copy.\nIn Python, a distinction between expressions and statements is rigidly enforced, in contrast to languages such as Common Lisp, Scheme, or Ruby. This distinction leads to duplicating some functionality, for example:\n- List comprehensions vs.\nfor\n-loops - Conditional expressions vs.\nif\nblocks - The\neval()\nvs.exec()\nbuilt-in functions (in Python 2,exec\nis a statement); the former function is for expressions, while the latter is for statements\nA statement cannot be part of an expression; because of this restriction, expressions such as list and dict\ncomprehensions (and lambda expressions) cannot contain statements. As a particular case, an assignment statement such as a = 1\ncannot be part of the conditional expression of a conditional statement.\nTyping\nPython uses duck typing, and it has typed objects but untyped variable names. Type constraints are not checked at definition time; rather, operations on an object may fail at usage time, indicating that the object is not of an appropriate type. Despite being dynamically typed, Python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are poorly defined (e.g., adding a number and a string) rather than quietly attempting to interpret them.\nPython allows programmers to define their own types using classes, most often for object-oriented programming. New instances of classes are constructed by calling the class, for example, SpamClass()\nor EggsClass()\n); the classes are instances of the metaclass type\n(which is an instance of itself), thereby allowing metaprogramming and reflection.\nBefore version 3.0, Python had two kinds of classes, both using the same syntax: old-style and new-style.[99] Current Python versions support the semantics of only the new style.\nPython supports optional type annotations.[5][100] These annotations are not enforced by the language, but may be used by external tools such as mypy to catch errors. Python includes a module typing\nincluding several type names for type annotations.[101][102] Also, Mypy supports a Python compiler called mypyc, which leverages type annotations for optimization.[103]\nArithmetic operations\nPython includes conventional symbols for arithmetic operators (+\n, -\n, *\n, /\n), the floor-division operator //\n, and the modulo operator %\n. (With the modulo operator, a remainder can be negative, e.g., 4 % -3 == -2\n.) Also, Python offers the **\nsymbol for exponentiation, e.g. 5**3 == 125\nand 9**0.5 == 3.0\n. Also, it offers the matrix\u2011multiplication operator @\n.[107] These operators work as in traditional mathematics; with the same precedence rules, the infix operators +\nand -\ncan also be unary, to represent positive and negative numbers respectively.\nDivision between integers produces floating-point results. The behavior of division has changed significantly over time:[108]\n- The current version of Python (i.e., since 3.0) changed the\n/\noperator to always represent floating-point division, e.g.,5/2 == 2.5\n. - The floor division\n//\noperator was introduced, meaning that7//3 == 2\n,-7//3 == -3\n,7.5//3 == 2.0\n, and-7.5//3 == -3.0\n. For Python 2.7, adding thefrom __future__ import division\nstatement allows a module in Python 2.7 to use Python 3.x rules for division (see above).\nIn Python terms, the /\noperator represents true division (or simply division), while the //\noperator represents floor division. Before version 3.0, the /\noperator represents classic division.[108]\nRounding towards negative infinity, though a different method than in most languages, adds consistency to Python. For instance, this rounding implies that the equation (a + b)//b == a//b + 1\nis always true. Also, the rounding implies that the equation b*(a//b) + a%b == a\nis valid for both positive and negative values of a\n. As expected, the result of a%b\nlies in the half-open interval [0, b), where b\nis a positive integer; however, maintaining the validity of the equation requires that the result must lie in the interval (b, 0] when b\nis negative.[109]\nPython provides a round\nfunction for rounding a float to the nearest integer. For tie-breaking, Python 3 uses the round to even method: round(1.5)\nand round(2.5)\nboth produce 2\n.[110] Python versions before 3 used the round-away-from-zero method: round(0.5)\nis 1.0\n, and round(-0.5)\nis \u22121.0\n.[111]\nPython allows Boolean expressions that contain multiple equality relations to be consistent with general usage in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c\ntests whether a\nis less than b\nand b\nis less than c\n.[112] C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b\n, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c\n.[113]\nPython uses arbitrary-precision arithmetic for all integer operations. The Decimal\ntype/class in the decimal\nmodule provides decimal floating-point numbers to a pre-defined arbitrary precision with several rounding modes.[114] The Fraction\nclass in the fractions\nmodule provides arbitrary precision for rational numbers.[115]\nDue to Python's extensive mathematics library and the third-party library NumPy, the language is frequently used for scientific scripting in tasks such as numerical data processing and manipulation.[116][117]\nFunction syntax\nFunctions are created in Python by using the def\nkeyword. A function is defined similarly to how it is called, by first providing the function name and then the required parameters. Here is an example of a function that prints its inputs:\ndef printer(input1, input2 = \"already there\"):\nprint(input1)\nprint(input2)\nprinter(\"hello\")\n# Example output:\n# hello\n# already there\nTo assign a default value to a function parameter in case no actual value is provided at run time, variable-definition syntax can be used inside the function header.\nCode examples\nprint('Hello, World!')\nProgram to calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer:\ntext = input('Type a number, and its factorial will be printed: ')\nn = int(text)\nif n < 0:\nraise ValueError('You must enter a non-negative integer')\nfactorial = 1\nfor i in range(2, n + 1):\nfactorial *= i\nprint(factorial)\nLibraries\nPython's large standard library[118] is commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths. For Internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as MIME and HTTP are supported. The language includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary-precision decimals,[114] manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.\nSome parts of the standard library are covered by specifications\u2014for example, the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) implementation wsgiref\nfollows PEP 333[119]\u2014but most parts are specified by their code, internal documentation, and test suites. However, because most of the standard library is cross-platform Python code, only a few modules must be altered or rewritten for variant implementations.\nAs of 13 March 2025,[update] the Python Package Index (PyPI), the official repository for third-party Python software, contains over 614,339[120] packages.\nDevelopment environments\nMost[which?] Python implementations (including CPython) include a read\u2013eval\u2013print loop (REPL); this permits the environment to function as a command line interpreter, with which users enter statements sequentially and receive results immediately.[121]\nAlso, CPython is bundled with an integrated development environment (IDE) called IDLE,[122] which is oriented toward beginners.[citation needed]\nOther shells, including IDLE and IPython, add additional capabilities such as improved auto-completion, session-state retention, and syntax highlighting.[122][123]\nStandard desktop IDEs include PyCharm, Spyder, and Visual Studio Code[124];there are web browser-based IDEs, such as the following environments:\n- Jupyter Notebooks, an open-source interactive computing platform;[125]\n- PythonAnywhere, a browser-based IDE and hosting environment; and\n- Canopy, a commercial IDE from Enthought that emphasizes scientific computing.[126][127]\nImplementations\nReference implementation\nCPython is the reference implementation of Python. This implementation is written in C, meeting the C11 standard[128] since version 3.11. Older versions use the C89 standard with several select C99 features, but third-party extensions are not limited to older C versions\u2014e.g., they can be implemented using C11 or C++.[129][130] CPython compiles Python programs into an intermediate bytecode,[131] which is then executed by a virtual machine.[132] CPython is distributed with a large standard library written in a combination of C and native Python.\nCPython is available for many platforms, including Windows and most modern Unix-like systems, including macOS (and Apple M1 Macs, since Python 3.9.1, using an experimental installer). Starting with Python 3.9, the Python installer intentionally fails to install on Windows 7 and 8;[133][134] Windows XP was supported until Python 3.5, with unofficial support for VMS.[135] Platform portability was one of Python's earliest priorities.[136] During development of Python 1 and 2, even OS/2 and Solaris were supported;[8] since that time, support has been dropped for many platforms.\nAll current Python versions (since 3.7) support only operating systems that feature multithreading, by now supporting not nearly as many operating systems (dropping many outdated) than in the past.\nLimitations of the reference implementation\n- The energy usage of Python with CPython for typically written code is much worse than C by a factor of 75.88.[137]\n- The throughput of Python with CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 71.9.[137]\n- The average memory usage of CPython for typically written code is worse than C by a factor of 2.4.[137]\nOther implementations\nAll alternative implementations have at least slightly different semantics. For example, an alternative may include unordered dictionaries, in contrast to other current Python versions. As another example in the larger Python ecosystem, PyPy does not support the full C Python API.\nCreating an executable with Python often is done by bundling an entire Python interpreter into the executable, which causes binary sizes to be massive for small programs,[138] yet there exist implementations that are capable of truly compiling Python. Alternative implementations include the following:\n- PyPy is a faster, compliant interpreter of Python 2.7 and 3.10.[139][140] PyPy's just-in-time compiler often improves speed significantly relative to CPython, but PyPy does not support some libraries written in C.[141] PyPy offers support for the RISC-V instruction-set architecture.\n- Codon is an implementation with an ahead-of-time (AOT) compiler, which compiles a statically-typed Python-like language whose \"syntax and semantics are nearly identical to Python's, there are some notable differences\"[142] For example, Codon uses 64-bit machine integers for speed, not arbitrarily as with Python; Codon developers claim that speedups over CPython are usually on the order of ten to a hundred times. Codon compiles to machine code (via LLVM) and supports native multithreading.[143] Codon can also compile to Python extension modules that can be imported and used from Python.\n- MicroPython and CircuitPython are Python 3 variants that are optimized for microcontrollers, including the Lego Mindstorms EV3.[144]\n- Pyston is a variant of the Python runtime that uses just-in-time compilation to speed up execution of Python programs.[145]\n- Cinder is a performance-oriented fork of CPython 3.8 that features a number of optimizations, including bytecode inline caching, eager evaluation of coroutines, a method-at-a-time JIT, and an experimental bytecode compiler.[146]\n- The Snek[147][148][149] embedded computing language \"is Python-inspired, but it is not Python. It is possible to write Snek programs that run under a full Python system, but most Python programs will not run under Snek.\"[150] Snek is compatible with 8-bit AVR microcontrollers such as ATmega 328P-based Arduino, as well as larger microcontrollers that are compatible with MicroPython. Snek is an imperative language that (unlike Python) omits object-oriented programming. Snek supports only one numeric data type, which features 32-bit single precision (resembling JavaScript numbers, though smaller).\nUnsupported implementations\nStackless Python is a significant fork of CPython that implements microthreads. This implementation uses the call stack differently, thus allowing massively concurrent programs. PyPy also offers a stackless version.[151]\nJust-in-time Python compilers have been developed, but are now unsupported:\n- Google began a project named Unladen Swallow in 2009: this project aimed to speed up the Python interpreter five-fold by using LLVM, and improve multithreading capability for scaling to thousands of cores,[152] while typical implementations are limited by the global interpreter lock.\n- Psyco is a discontinued just-in-time specializing compiler, which integrates with CPython and transforms bytecode to machine code at runtime. The emitted code is specialized for certain data types and is faster than standard Python code. Psyco does not support Python 2.7 or later.\n- PyS60 was a Python 2 interpreter for Series 60 mobile phones, which was released by Nokia in 2005. The interpreter implemented many modules from Python's standard library, as well as additional modules for integration with the Symbian operating system. The Nokia N900 also supports Python through the GTK widget library, allowing programs to be written and run on the target device.[153]\nTranspilers to other languages\nThere are several compilers/transpilers to high-level object languages; the source language is unrestricted Python, a subset of Python, or a language similar to Python:\n- Brython[154] and Transcrypt[155][156] compile Python to JavaScript.\n- Cython compiles a superset of Python to C. The resulting code can be used with Python via direct C-level API calls into the Python interpreter.\n- PyJL compiles/transpiles a subset of Python to \"human-readable, maintainable, and high-performance Julia source code\".[76] Despite the developers' performance claims, this is not possible for arbitrary Python code; that is, compiling to a faster language or machine code is known to be impossible in the general case. The semantics of Python might potentially be changed, but in many cases speedup is possible with few or no changes in the Python code. The faster Julia source code can then be used from Python or compiled to machine code.\n- Nuitka compiles Python into C.[157] This compiler works with Python 3.4 to 3.13 (and 2.6 and 2.7) for Python's main supported platforms (and Windows 7 or even Windows XP) and for Android. The compiler developers claim full support for Python 3.10, partial support for Python 3.11 and 3.12, and experimental support for Python 3.13. Nuitka supports macOS including Apple Silicon-based versions. The compiler is free of cost, though it has commercial add-ons (e.g., for hiding source code).\n- Numba is a JIT compiler that is used from Python; the compiler translates a subset of Python and NumPy code into fast machine code. This tool is enabled by adding a decorator to the relevant Python code.\n- Pythran compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++11).[158]\n- RPython can be compiled to C, and it is used to build the PyPy interpreter for Python.\n- The Python \u2192 11l \u2192 C++ transpiler[159] compiles a subset of Python 3 to C++ (C++17).\nThere are also specialized compilers:\n- MyHDL is a Python-based hardware description language (HDL) that converts MyHDL code to Verilog or VHDL code.\nSome older projects existed, as well as compilers not designed for use with Python 3.x and related syntax:\n- Google's Grumpy transpiles Python 2 to Go.[160][161][162] The latest release was in 2017.\n- IronPython allows running Python 2.7 programs with the .NET Common Language Runtime.[163] An alpha version (released in 2021), is available for \"Python 3.4, although features and behaviors from later versions may be included.\"[164]\n- Jython compiles Python 2.7 to Java bytecode, allowing the use of Java libraries from a Python program.[165]\n- Pyrex (last released in 2010) and Shed Skin (last released in 2013) compile to C and C++ respectively.\nPerformance\nA performance comparison among various Python implementations, using a non-numerical (combinatorial) workload, was presented at EuroSciPy '13.[166] In addition, Python's performance relative to other programming languages is benchmarked by The Computer Language Benchmarks Game.[167]\nThere are several approaches to optimizing Python performance, despite the inherent slowness of an interpreted language. These approaches include the following strategies or tools:\n- Just-in-time compilation: Dynamically compiling parts of a Python program during the execution of the program. This technique is used in libraries such as Numba and PyPy.\n- Static compilation: Sometimes, Python code can be compiled into machine code sometime before execution. An example of this approach is Cython, which compiles Python into C.\n- Concurrency and parallelism: Multiple tasks can be run simultaneously. Python contains modules such as `multiprocessing` to support this form of parallelism. Moreover, this approach helps to overcome limitations of the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in CPU tasks.\n- Efficient data structures: Performance can also be improved by using data types such as\nSet\nfor membership tests, ordeque\nfromcollections\nfor queue operations. - Performance gains can be observed by utilizing libraries such as NumPy. Most high performance Python libraries use C or Fortran under the hood instead of the Python interpreter.[168]\nLanguage Development\nPython's development is conducted mostly through the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process; this process is the primary mechanism for proposing major new features, collecting community input on issues, and documenting Python design decisions.[169] Python coding style is covered in PEP 8.[84] Outstanding PEPs are reviewed and commented on by the Python community and the steering council.[169]\nEnhancement of the language corresponds with development of the CPython reference implementation. The mailing list python-dev is the primary forum for the language's development. Specific issues were originally discussed in the Roundup bug tracker hosted by the foundation.[170] In 2022, all issues and discussions were migrated to GitHub.[171] Development originally took place on a self-hosted source-code repository running Mercurial, until Python moved to GitHub in January 2017.[172]\nCPython's public releases have three types, distinguished by which part of the version number is incremented:\n- Backward-incompatible versions, where code is expected to break and must be manually ported. The first part of the version number is incremented. These releases happen infrequently\u2014version 3.0 was released 8 years after 2.0. According to Guido van Rossum, a version 4.0 will probably never exist.[173]\n- Major or \"feature\" releases are largely compatible with the previous version but introduce new features. The second part of the version number is incremented. Starting with Python 3.9, these releases are expected to occur annually.[174][175] Each major version is supported by bug fixes for several years after its release.[176]\n- Bug fix releases,[177] which introduce no new features, occur approximately every three months; these releases are made when a sufficient number of bugs have been fixed upstream since the last release. Security vulnerabilities are also patched in these releases. The third and final part of the version number is incremented.[177]\nMany alpha, beta, and release-candidates are also released as previews and for testing before final releases. Although there is a rough schedule for releases, they are often delayed if the code is not ready yet. Python's development team monitors the state of the code by running a large unit test suite during development.[178]\nThe major academic conference on Python is PyCon. Also, there are special Python mentoring programs, such as PyLadies.\nNaming\nPython's name is inspired by the British comedy group Monty Python, whom Python creator Guido van Rossum enjoyed while developing the language. Monty Python references appear frequently in Python code and culture;[179] for example, the metasyntactic variables often used in Python literature are spam and eggs, rather than the traditional foo and bar.[179][180] Also, the official Python documentation contains various references to Monty Python routines.[181][182] Python users are sometimes referred to as \"Pythonistas\".[183]\nLanguages influenced by Python\n- Cobra has an Acknowledgements document that lists Python first among influencing languages.[184]\n- ECMAScript and JavaScript borrowed iterators and generators from Python.[185]\n- Go is designed for \"speed of working in a dynamic language like Python\".[186]\n- Julia was designed to be \"as usable for general programming as Python\".[187]\n- Mojo is almost[29][188] a superset of Python.[189]\n- GDScript is strongly influenced by Python. [190]\n- Groovy, Boo, CoffeeScript, F#, Nim, Ring,[30] Ruby,[31] Swift,[32] and V[33] have been influenced, as well.\nSee also\n- List of Python programming books\n- pip (package manager)\n- Pydoc\n- NumPy\n- SciPy\n- Jupyter\n- Pytorch\n- Cython\n- CPython\n- Mojo\n- Pygame\n- PyQt\n- PyGTK\n- PyPy\n- PyCon\n- Google Colab \u2013 zero setup online IDE that runs Python\nNotes\n- ^ since 3.5, but those hints are ignored, except with unofficial tools[5]\n- ^\n- Tier 1: 64-bit Linux, macOS; 64- and 32-bit Windows 8.1 and later with older Python versions[6]\n- Tier 2: E.g. 32-bit WebAssembly (WASI)\n- Tier 3: 64-bit Android,[7] iOS, FreeBSD, and (32-bit) Raspberry Pi OS\nUnofficial (or has been known to work): Other Unix-like/BSD variants) and a few other platforms[8][9][10]\n- ^\ndel\nin Python does not behave the same waydelete\nin languages such as C++ does, where such a word is used to call the destructor and deallocate heap memory.\nReferences\n- ^ \"General Python FAQ \u2013 Python 3 documentation\". docs.python.org.

      "content": "Constructing Knowledge Through Python Coding\nOur Intro to Python computer science course content emphasizes students applying and exploring the information presented. To provide a thorough introduction to Python programming, a code editor accompanies each page with new concepts so students can see for themselves how the computer responds to code.\nIn addition, the content provides code snippets to get students started as well as suggested avenues for investigation. At the end of each module, students are asked to apply the skills they learned in a lab.\nAuto-graded assessments and instant learner feedback\nStudents receive immediate, rich feedback. In addition to correctness feedback (i.e. right or wrong), students will also see an explanation with the complete solution.\nThere are a wide variety of questions - all of which are auto-graded, giving students a sense of their understanding of the material right after they are introduced to it and as they attempt harder and harder problems. Auto-graded assessments also include five coding exercises at the end of each module, where students are evaluated on the code they write.\nLowering the Barrier to Entry\nThis Python intro course material reflects the need for computer science education to meet students where they are. Like any specialized community, computer science has its own jargon. The formal teaching of computer science should not burden students with the assumption that they are fluent in this special language.\nThe material is presented in smaller units that are more manageable for the students. The same vocabulary and concepts are covered, but in a more approachable way - state things as plainly as possible, and, when appropriate, use images, tables, or lists.\nAnother way in which our intro to Python programming content is more approachable is that it uses many small programs instead of one large program. Research shows that a variety of smaller problems increase student performance and reduce stress. Using many small programs leads to students spending a sufficient amount of time on their work, and they do not wait until the last moment to begin their work.\nEncouraging Customization Through Modularity\nThis content is not a one-size-fits-all solution. Instead, it implements a modular format. Natural breakpoints occur in the curriculum where instructors can make necessary changes. Instructors can rename, re-order, or remove units and can author new material using Codio's powerful curriculum content authoring tools, giving complete flexibility when designing the learner's experience.\nWhat's Included\n- Interactive content in Python with visuals and minimal text for maximum hands-on engagement\n- Example code snippets that can be copied\n- A fully-featured web-based IDE\n- Run code with the click of a button\n- Use Code Visualizer to see \"under the hood\"\n- Parsons Problems and other formative assessments to help students check their understanding\nSenior Lecturer, Sheffield University\nCEO & Founder of Code Wiz\nLecturer, Coventry University",
