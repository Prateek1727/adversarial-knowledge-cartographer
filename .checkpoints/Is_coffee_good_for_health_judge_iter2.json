      "content": "Turns out that coffee's good for more than jump-starting our mornings or keeping us awake during meetings. A lot of recent research suggests that coffee offers a host of potential health benefits.\nEvery day, Americans drink 400 million cups of this incredibly complex beverage, which contains more than 1,000 compounds that can affect the body. The most commonly studied are caffeine (a nervous-system stimulant that's known to have positive cognitive effects) and polyphenols (antioxidants that can help slow or prevent cell damage).\nWhat health benefits does coffee offer?\nThough researchers don't always know exactly which of coffee's ingredients are responsible for producing their studies' health-boosting results, there's evidence that drinking coffee may help do the following:\n1. Improve overall health.\nAn analysis of nearly 220 studies on coffee, published in the BMJ in 2017, found that coffee drinkers may enjoy more overall health benefits than people who don't drink coffee.\nThe analysis found that during the study period, coffee drinkers were 17% less likely to die early from any cause, 19% less likely to die of heart disease and 18% less likely to develop cancer than those who don't drink coffee.\n2. Protect against Type 2 diabetes.\nA 2014 study by Harvard researchers published in the journal Diabetologica tracked nearly 124,000 people for 16 to 20 years.\nThose who increased their coffee intake by more than a cup a day over a four-year period had an 11% lower risk of developing Type 2 diabetes; those who decreased their intake by one cup per day had a 17% higher risk of developing the disease.\nThe reason may be the antioxidants in coffee, which reduce inflammation (inflammation contributes to your Type 2 diabetes risk).\nIf you already have Type 2 diabetes, however, you should avoid caffeinated products, including coffee. Caffeine has been shown to raise both blood sugar and insulin levels in people with the disease.\n3. Control Parkinson's disease symptoms.\nA number of studies have suggested that consuming caffeine can reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease \u2014 and research published in 2012 in the journal of the American Academy of Neurology showed that a daily dose of caffeine equivalent to that found in two eight-ounce cups of black coffee can help to control the involuntary movements of people who already have the disease. (You'd have to drink nearly eight cups of brewed black tea to get the same amount of caffeine.)\n4. Slow the progress of dementia.\nIn a 2012 study published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, Florida researchers tested the blood levels of caffeine in older adults with mild cognitive impairments, which can be a precursor to severe dementia, including Alzheimer's disease.\nWhen the researchers re-evaluated the subjects two to four years later, those whose blood levels contained caffeine amounts equivalent to about three cups of coffee were far less likely to have progressed to full-blown dementia than those who had consumed little or no caffeine.\n5. Safeguard the liver.\nSeveral studies published in respected journals have found that coffee drinking has beneficial effects on the liver, including reducing the risk of death from liver cirrhosis, decreasing harmful liver enzyme levels and limiting liver scarring in people who have hepatitis C.\n6. Promote heart health.\nAccording to a study published in 2021 in the American Heart Association journal Circulation: Heart Failure, drinking one or more daily cups of plain, caffeinated coffee was associated with a significant reduction in a person's long-term risk of heart failure.\nThe study looked at the original data from three well-known heart disease studies: the Framingham Heart Study, the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study and the Cardiovascular Health Study.\nAlthough there's not enough evidence to support prescribing coffee to lower your risk of heart disease risk, this recent revelation seems to strengthen previous findings that coffee is, in fact, good for heart health.\nIn 2013, the journal Epidemiology and Prevention published a review of studies analyzing the correlation between coffee consumption and cardiovascular disease. Data from 36 different studies showed that people who drink three to five cups of coffee per day had a lower risk of heart disease than those who drink no coffee or more than five cups per day.\nWhile the reason isn't clear, one possibility is that coffee helps to improve blood vessels' control over blood flow and blood pressure.\n7. Reduce melanoma risk.\nA 2015 study appearing in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute looked at the coffee-drinking habits of more than 447,000 people over 10 years. The researchers found that those who drank four or more cups of caffeinated coffee each day had a 20% lower risk of developing melanoma than people who drank decaffeinated coffee or no coffee.\n8. Lower mortality risk\nYour morning coffee could help lower your risk of death. A 2022 study in The Annals of Internal Medicine has shown that moderate consumption of unsweetened and sugar-sweetened coffee was associated with a reduced risk of mortality. The research shows that those who drank 1.5 to 3.5 cups of coffee per day, including with sugar, had a 30% less lower risk of death from any cause during the study.\nAdvice for coffee drinkers\nWe asked Steven K. Rothschild, MD, a family medicine physician at Rush University Medical Center and a dedicated two- to-three-cup-a-day man (black, no sweetener) to weigh in.\nWhile he's never gone so far as to prescribe a daily dose of java for any of his patients, he says, \"I'm certainly familiar with a lot of research showing that coffee has a mildly beneficial effect in protecting against issues like stroke, diabetes and cardiovascular problems.\"\nHe offers a few caveats, however:\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors.\nDon't doctor up your drink.\n\"Keep in mind that the research focuses on the benefits of black coffee, which we're still learning about,\" Rothschild says. \"But we definitely know the harms associated with the fat and sugar you find in a lot of coffee drinks.\"\nA Starbucks Venti White Chocolate Mocha, for instance, has 580 calories, 22 grams of fat (15 of which are saturated) and 75 grams of sugar. A plain cup of brewed coffee? Two calories, no fat and zero carbs.\nIf you can't drink it black, stick with low-calorie, low-fat add-ins, such as skim milk or almond milk.\nCoffee is for grownups only.\n\"It's not true that coffee will stunt kids' growth, as parents used to be fond of saying,\" Rothschild says. But there are a few good reasons for kids not to drink coffee or other caffeinated drinks (e.g., colas and energy drinks).\nOne study, published in 2014 in the journal Pediatrics, showed that even small amounts of caffeine, equivalent to one cup of coffee, increased children's blood pressure and \u2014 to compensate for the rise in blood pressure \u2014 slowed heart rates.\nBeyond that, Rothschild says, he'd be concerned about sleep disruption and behavioral issues that might result from ingesting a stimulant.\nSwitch to decaf if you have acid reflux ...\n\"Caffeine causes the gastroesophageal sphincter to relax, which allows acid to enter the esophagus,\" Rothschild explains.\n... or insomnia ...\n\"People who have trouble sleeping can get into a vicious cycle: They sleep badly, increase their caffeine intake the next day to compensate, then sleep badly again, and on and on,\" he says, suggesting that people with insomnia avoid all caffeine after noon.\n... or osteoporosis.\n\"There's some evidence showing that moderate to high coffee consumption \u2014 more than four cups per day \u2014 is linked with calcium loss and fractures,\" says Rothschild.\nBut if you do drink decaf, definitely limit your consumption. That study in Circulation: Heart Failure found that decaffeinated coffee was actually associated with an increased risk for heart failure.\nEnjoy coffee in moderation.\nBottom line? Enjoy a daily cup or two of coffee, Rothschild says, but don't use it as a substitute for other healthy behaviors. \"Unless you have a condition like reflux, it's fine to keep drinking a reasonable amount of coffee,\" he says.\nBut you can also try other healthy ways to get some of the benefits you might attribute to coffee.\n\"For instance, if you rely on coffee to fight after-lunch sluggishness every day, you might think about getting outside and going for a 10 to 20 minute walk,\" Rothschild suggests. \"It'll not only wake you up, but you'll also get a lot of benefits in terms of bone health and cardiovascular health.\"",

This review examines coffee's multifaceted impact on health and well-being, drawing on decades of research. Overall, the consensus is that moderate coffee intake is more beneficial than harmful across a wide range of health outcomes. Numerous large-scale, prospective cohort studies from around the world have consistently shown that moderate coffee consumption-typically three to five cups per day-is associated with reduced overall mortality and lower risk of major diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, stroke, respiratory conditions, cognitive decline, and potentially several types of cancer, including liver and uterine cancers. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee have shown benefits. The addition of sugar and cream to coffee may attenuate coffee's positive health effects. Despite historical concerns, coffee consumption is not linked to increased risks of cancer, hypertension, or arrhythmia. However, some concerns remain. For pregnant women, coffee consumption should be limited to lower amounts, such that the daily intake of caffeine does not exceed 200 mg/day. Also, excessive caffeinated coffee intake may cause anxiety or sleep disturbances. Coffee's health-promoting mechanisms include improved glucose balancing, increased physical activity, increased fat oxidation, improved lung function, and reduced inflammation. Beyond mortality and chronic diseases, coffee consumption affects many aspects of well-being: it supports hydration, boosts mental acuity, enhances physical performance, and may aid bowel recovery after surgery. While the field is well-studied via long-term observational cohorts, future research should focus on randomized controlled trials, Mendelian randomization studies, and granular analyses of coffee types and additives.\nKeywords: caffeine; cancer risk reduction; cardiovascular mortality; chronic disease prevention; coffee; cognitive decline mitigation; pregnancy and caffeine safety.\nConflict of interest statement\nDr. Kamangar has served as a consultant for the National Coffee Association.

      "title": "Is Coffee Good For You? 15 Evidence-Based Coffee Benefits - ZOE",
      "content": "Updated 11th November 2025\nWhat are the health benefits of coffee?\nCoffee is a drink enjoyed by millions. And the latest research suggests that it might provide a range of health benefits.\nThese benefits are varied and likely stem from the vitamins and minerals within the bean itself. During brewing, these nutrients seep into the dark liquid.\nLet\u2019s dig into the research and look at the potential health benefits of coffee.\n1. Improves microbiome diversity\nYour gut microbiome contains trillions of microorganisms. And having a diverse gut microbiome is associated with good health.\nZOE\u2019s PREDICT studies found that coffee drinkers tended to have more diversity in their microbiomes. One possible explanation has to do with the soluble fiber and prebiotic properties in coffee that feed beneficial gut bugs.\nIn a ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast on coffee, Prof. Tim Spector, ZOE's scientific co-founder and an expert on the gut microbiome, explained:\n\"It's probably the drink you have regularly that contains the most fiber. There's more fiber in it than a glass of orange juice.\"\nThere's a long list of ways to improve your gut health, and it seems that coffee might be on that list.\n2. Improves cognitive function\nSome research suggests that coffee may be good for long-term cognitive health, including better memory and improved attention. However, other scientists haven't found this benefit.\nCoffee may also slow cognitive decline and lower your chances of developing Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\nInterestingly, caffeine alone may not be responsible. Studies in mice show that other compounds in coffee may contribute to these effects.\nA study comparing decaffeinated and caffeinated coffee didn't find any cognitive benefits linked to decaffeinated coffee.\nStill, a wide range of factors influence brain health, and scientists need to carry out much more research to understand the precise links between coffee and thinking ability.\n3. Reduces the risk of gallstone diseases\nDrinking coffee may reduce your risk of developing gallstones later in life.\nA recent study determined that drinking at least 6 cups a day was associated with a 23% reduced risk of developing symptomatic gallstone disease, compared with drinking no coffee.\nBut if you currently have gallstones, you may want to avoid coffee, due to the stimulating effect it has on the gallbladder.\n4. Decreases cancer risk\nCoffee has dozens of compounds that may contribute to your health.\nFor instance, researchers recently showed that two compounds \u2014 kahweol and cafestol \u2014 stopped the growth of prostate and kidney cancer cells in a laboratory study.\nHowever, what happens in a test tube doesn't always match what happens in your body.\nWith that said, there is mounting evidence that coffee consumption is linked to a lower risk of certain cancers, such as liver, prostate, breast, colorectal, and potentially endometrial cancer.\n5. Heals damaged cells\nAntioxidants help prevent and repair damage to cells and genetic material around your body.\nResearch has shown that coffee is a significant source of polyphenols, a type of antioxidant, in many people's diets. Polyphenols also help fuel your \"good\" gut bacteria.\nOne polyphenol in coffee is called chlorogenic acid. Some researchers have linked this antioxidant to metaboilic benefits. They believe that chlorogenic acid might reduce the risk of a range of conditions, including cancer, diabetes, and obesity.\nOther dietary sources of polyphenols include fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though many people don\u2019t eat enough of these.\nTake a quiz to find out how personalized food recommendations can improve your health.\n6. Lowers the risk of Parkinson's disease\nCoffee may have neuroprotective properties and could lower the risk of developing Parkinson\u2019s disease, the second most common neurodegenerative disease (after Alzheimer\u2019s).\nA number of studies have investigated and suggest that people who drink 5 or more cups of coffee a day may have a reduced risk.\nThere's also some evidence that drinking coffee might slow the progression of Parkinson's in people who already have it.\nHowever, scientists need to carry out more research in larger populations to confirm these findings.\nJoin our mailing list\nOpt in to receive ongoing science and nutrition emails, news and offers from ZOE. You can unsubscribe at any time.\n7. Protects against diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is one of the most common chronic conditions. It affects nearly 10% of people in the U.S.\nThe risk factors for developing type 2 diabetes include having a sedentary lifestyle, being overweight, and being 45 or older.\nA review concluded that people who drink 4 or more cups of coffee a day had less risk of developing type 2 diabetes than those who drank fewer than 2 cups a day.\nHowever, as the review's authors explain, scientists need to explore this connection further.\nA more recent review, published in 2018, found that the risk of diabetes dropped by 6% for each cup of coffee consumed daily.\n8. Improves bowel regularity\nWe\u2019re sure you saw this one coming. Coffee's laxative effect is well-known. Nearly a third of coffee drinkers report needing to use the bathroom within 30 minutes post-brew.\nIf you struggle to have regular bowel movements, coffee might be a healthy way to get things moving.\n9. Increases physical activity levels\nMany of us rely on coffee to give us a jolt of energy. So, it makes sense that this energy boost results in more exercise throughout the day.\nMiddle-aged female participants in a public health study were 17% more likely to reach their physical activity goals if they drank 1\u20132 cups of coffee each day, compared with participants who drank less coffee or none.\n10. Decreases stroke risk\nThe Nurses\u2019 Health Study, which evaluated 83,076 nurses\u2019 diets, found that moderate coffee consumption was modestly associated with decreased stroke risk.\nRecent research echoes this and suggests that people who drink between half a cup and 3 cups of coffee a day have a 21% lower risk of stroke than those who don\u2019t drink coffee.\nSimilarly, a review and meta-analysis using data from more than 2.4 million people also concluded that coffee was associated with a reduced risk of stroke.\n11. Helps maintain weight loss\nAs long as you don\u2019t load up your coffee with sweeteners, you might find that your morning caffeine habit contributes to weight loss.\nOne study found that coffee drinkers were more likely to keep weight off over time, compared with non-coffee drinkers.\nAlthough the evidence isn't super strong, a review and meta-analysis concluded that increased caffeine intake was linked to reduced body mass index, weight, and fat mass.\nThese effects might stem from caffeine\u2019s role as an appetite suppressant and its effect on metabolic activity.\n12. Protects liver health\nCoffee consumption is associated with a protective effect against chronic liver disease.\nFor instance, a systematic review and meta-analysis found that coffee protects against liver fibrosis in people with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease \u2014 the most common cause of chronic liver disease.\nSimilarly, a large study with almost half a million participants found that 3\u20134 cups of coffee reduced the risk of all types of chronic liver disease. These conditions include cirrhosis, fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma, the most common type of liver cancer.\n13. Decreases inflammation markers\nInflammation is a healthy response to injury or infection. However, if it continues for long periods when there's no injury or infection, it can cause health problems. This is called chronic inflammation.\nScientists have found links between chronic inflammation and conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes.\nDiet, physical activity, and stress levels all contribute to how much chronic inflammation is present in your body.\nAccording to some scientists, coffee might help reduce inflammation. However, the relationship between inflammation and coffee is likely complex, and scientists need to do more work.\n14. Decreases the risk of heart disease\nEvidence is mounting that coffee may protect heart health. For instance, one large study concluded that coffee consumption was associated with a long-term lower risk of developing heart failure.\nAnd according to a review, drinking 3\u20135 cups a day is linked to a 15% reduction in cardiovascular disease, compared with drinking none.\nHowever, the authors note that people with high blood pressure or poorly controlled blood pressure shouldn't consume large amounts of caffeine.\nIn the ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast on coffee, Prof. Spector explains, \"It's only really the last 5 years that the evidence has accumulated so much that it's incontrovertible that coffee drinkers have less heart disease than non-coffee drinkers.\"\n15. Possibly lowers depression risk\nScientists have found that people who drink at least 4 cups of coffee a day have a significantly lower risk of developing depression than those who drink less than 1 cup a day.\nBut so far, studies have only been observational. This means that it's not possible to tease apart cause and effect.\nFor instance, it might be that people who don't have depression are more likely to drink more coffee, rather than coffee directly reducing depression risk.\nFor more information on the overall health benefits of coffee, watch the video of the ZOE Science & Nutrition podcast in which Prof. Tim Spector and James Hoffman spill the beans.\nCoffee and health considerations\nWith coffee, dosage really matters, and some people can tolerate more than others.\nAs Prof. Spector, explains, \u201cCaffeine tolerance is highly personal, and there are some factors that you can\u2019t control \u2014 such as your genes.\u201d\n\u201cOur latest PREDICT study showed that coffee drinkers have very different gut microbiomes, and this could also play a part in tolerance levels.\u201d\nPeople who metabolize coffee slowly tend to have jitters, anxiety, and sleep disruptions. Those who metabolize coffee quickly, however, often have very few side effects.\nExperimenting can help you recognize how much, if any, is right for you. If you drink coffee and notice anxiety, negative mood changes, sleep problems, or headaches, you might want to reduce your intake.\nPregnant women should be extra cautious. The recommended limit during pregnancy is 12 ounces \u2014 or 1.5 cups \u2014 per day.\nAs always, listening to your body is key.\nThe crunch your gut\u2019s* been craving.\nSupport gut health* and energy* and enhance the flavor and crunch of your meals.\nSummary\nIf you love coffee's ability to get you going in the morning, rest easy. You\u2019re probably receiving health benefits along with your caffeine fix.\nFrom diversifying your gut microbiome to lowering the risk of some conditions \u2014 coffee is a beloved beverage with plenty of perks.\nIf you want to learn more about the composition of your gut microbiome, check out ZOE\u2019s at-home test kit, and learn why there's no one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition.\nSources\nA daily cup of tea or coffee may keep you moving: Association between tea and coffee consumption and physical activity.

      "content": "A Closer Look at 3 Health Benefits of Drinking Coffee\nCan coffee actually improve your heart health? We\u2019ll spill the beans.\nMar. 18, 2025\nEspresso, latte, cappuccino \u2014 whatever your go-to order is, you\u2019ve probably wondered: Is drinking coffee bad? Is it actually good? Differing opinions have long made caffeine fans stir, but poring over new scientific studies just might provide you with grounds for reassurance.\nAlthough it\u2019s important to know that it can affect people differently, the bottom line is coffee can be good for your health. Here, we\u2019ll serve up three reasons:\nCoffee Can Reduce Your Risk of Heart Disease \u2014 If You Time it Right\nThe case for coffee is becoming stronger. In fact, recent research suggests people who drink coffee have a lower risk of death from cardiovascular disease. You\u2019ll just want to be sure to drink your cup of joe in the morning.\nA recent study of nearly 41,000 adults found that morning coffee drinkers were 31 percent less likely to die of heart disease and 16 percent less likely to have died in general compared to all-day coffee consumers. Why? Researchers estimate that drinking coffee later in the day may disrupt our body\u2019s circadian rhythms, causing changes to cardiovascular risk factors such as inflammation and blood pressure.\nIn the U.S., cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death. And while many look to their diet to help reduce their risk, often reevaluating every nutrition choice, you can rest easy knowing your morning coffee intake isn\u2019t harming your heart health.\nBut Does Coffee Increase Blood Pressure?\nCaffeine, a main ingredient in coffee, can affect people differently, especially if it\u2019s not something you consume regularly. In that case, caffeine can briefly cause your blood pressure to rise and your heart rate to quicken \u2014 that\u2019s where the talk of \u201cjitters\u201d comes in. But that increase is only temporary and isn\u2019t cause for concern, the Mayo Clinic says.\nCoffee fanatics know that you build a tolerance to caffeine when you drink it regularly. This means caffeine does not have a long-term effect on blood pressure and is not linked to a higher risk.\nCoffee is an Anti-Inflammatory and Antioxidant\nFurther, another recent study found that diets rich in polyphenols, which are antioxidant and anti-inflammatory plant compounds that can boost heart health and your immune system, can reduce the risk of metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions, including increased blood pressure and high glucose levels, that increases your risk of developing heart disease, stroke and type 2 diabetes.\nWhy is this relevant? Coffee contains polyphenols, meaning your morning brew also offers you antioxidants that can reduce inflammation and protect against disease.\n\u201cCoffee can be thought of as contributing to your overall fluid intake, but it shouldn\u2019t replace water, of course. Coffee consumption can be tied to a variety of health benefits, is an excellent source of potassium and gives some antioxidant value,\u201d said Pam Nisevich Bede, head of nutrition for Abbott\u2019s Lingo consumer biowearable.\nIs There Such Thing as \u2018Too Much\u2019?\nThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration says that, for adults, about 400 milligrams of caffeine per day is safe. That\u2019s about two to three cups of brewed coffee. However, if you are sensitive to caffeine or have an easily upset stomach, you may want to drink less.\n\u201cSome studies point to a health benefit at an intake of three to four cups per day whereas others do not define recommended intake or find that benefits continue across the whole coffee consumption range. Still, everyone responds to coffee and caffeine differently, and this extends to whether it affects your glucose or not,\u201d Nisevich Bede said.\n\u201cBut what we\u2019re adding to our coffee is also important, as creamers, flavorings and sugars can be a significant source of calories and sugars,\u201d Nisevich Bede said. \u201cAlternatively, what you add can also be beneficial such as a source of healthy fats, vitamins, minerals and protein. You want to be thoughtful about what you\u2019re mixing into your coffee, how sensitive you are to caffeine and the point of the day you should stop.\u201d\nIn sum, coffee isn\u2019t something to steam over. Instead, raise a cup to the fact it can actually be good for your heart health.\nRelated articles\n-\nDiabetes Care\nDiabetes and Heart Disease: How to Manage Your Risk\nYou are, after all, your own best champion.

      "content": "Coffee lovers around the world who reach for their favorite morning brew probably aren\u2019t thinking about its health benefits or risks. And yet this beverage has been subject to a long history of debate. In 1991 coffee was included in a list of possible carcinogens by the World Health Organization. By 2016 it was exonerated, as research found that the beverage was not associated with an increased risk of cancer; on the contrary, there was a decreased risk of certain cancers among those who drink coffee regularly once smoking history was properly accounted for. Additional accumulating research suggests that when consumed in moderation, coffee can be considered a healthy beverage. Why then in 2018 did one U.S. state pass legislation that coffee must bear a cancer warning label? Read on to explore the complexities of coffee.\nPlant chemicals: polyphenols including chlorogenic acid and quinic acid, and diterpenes including cafestol and kahweol\nOne 8-ounce cup of brewed coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine. A moderate amount of coffee is generally defined as 3-5 cups a day, or on average 400 mg of caffeine, according to the Dietary Guidelines for Americans.\nCoffee and Health\nCoffee is an intricate mixture of more than a thousand chemicals. [1] The cup of coffee you order from a coffee shop is likely different from the coffee you brew at home. What defines a cup is the type of coffee bean used, how it is roasted, the amount of grind, and how it is brewed. Human response to coffee or caffeine can also vary substantially across individuals. Low to moderate doses of caffeine (50\u2013300 mg) may cause increased alertness, energy, and ability to concentrate, while higher doses may have negative effects such as anxiety, restlessness, insomnia, and increased heart rate. [2] Still, the cumulative research on coffee points in the direction of a health benefit. [3,4] Does the benefit stem from the caffeine or plant compounds in the coffee bean? Is there a certain amount of coffee needed a day to produce a health benefit?\nCancer\nCoffee may affect how cancer develops, ranging from the initiation of a cancer cell to its death. For example, coffee may stimulate the production of bile acids and speed digestion through the colon, which can lower the amount of carcinogens to which colon tissue is exposed. Various polyphenols in coffee have been shown to prevent cancer cell growth in animal studies. Coffee has also been associated with decreased estrogen levels, a hormone linked to several types of cancer. [5] Caffeine itself may interfere with the growth and spread of cancer cells. [6] Coffee also appears to lower inflammation, a risk factor for many cancers.\nThe 2018 uproar in California due to warning labels placed on coffee products stemmed from a chemical in the beverage called acrylamide, which is formed when the beans are roasted. Acrylamide is also found in some starchy foods that are processed with high heat like French fries, cookies, crackers, and potato chips. It was classified in the National Toxicology Program\u2019s 2014 Report on Carcinogens, as \u201creasonably anticipated to be a human carcinogen\u201d based on studies in lab animals. However, there is not yet evidence of a health effect in humans from eating acrylamide in food. Regardless, in March 2018 a California judge ruled that all California coffee sellers must warn consumers about the \u201cpotential cancer risk\u201d from drinking coffee, because coffee-selling companies failed to show that acrylamide did not pose a significant health risk. California\u2019s law Proposition 65, or The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986, fueled the ruling, which requires a warning label to be placed on any ingredient from a list of 900 confirmed or suspected carcinogens.\nHowever, many cancer experts disputed the ruling, stating that the metabolism of acrylamide differs considerably in animals and humans, and the high amount of acrylamide used in animal research is not comparable to the amount present in food. They cited the beneficial health effects of coffee, with improved antioxidant responses and reduced inflammation, both factors important in cancer prevention. Evidence from the American Institute for Cancer Research concludes that drinking coffee may reduce risk for endometrial and liver cancer, and based on a systematic review of a large body of research, it is not a risk for the cancers that were studied.\nIn June 2018, the California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment (OEHHA) proposed a new regulation exempting coffee from displaying cancer warnings under Proposition 65. This proposal was based on a review of more than 1,000 studies published by the World Health Organization\u2019s International Agency for Research on Cancer that found inadequate evidence that drinking coffee causes cancer. In January 2019, OEHHA completed its review and response to comments and submitted the regulation to the Office of Administrative Law (OAL) for final review.\nType 2 Diabetes\nAlthough ingestion of caffeine can increase blood sugar in the short-term, long-term studies have shown that habitual coffee drinkers have a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes compared with non-drinkers. The polyphenols and minerals such as magnesium in coffee may improve the effectiveness of insulin and glucose metabolism in the body.\nIn a meta-analysis of 45,335 people with type 2 diabetes followed for up to 20 years, an association was found with increasing cups of coffee and a lower risk of developing diabetes. Compared with no coffee, the decreased risk ranged from 8% with 1 cup a day to 33% for 6 cups a day. Caffeinated coffee showed a slightly greater benefit than decaffeinated coffee. [7]\nAnother meta-analysis of prospective cohort studies showed similar associations. When comparing the highest intake of coffee (up to 10 cups a day) with the lowest (<1 cup), there was a 30% decreased risk of type 2 diabetes in those drinking the highest amounts of coffee and caffeine and a 20% decreased risk when drinking decaffeinated coffee. Further analysis showed that the incidence of diabetes decreased by 12% for every 2 extra cups of coffee a day, and 14% for every 200 mg a day increase in caffeine intake (up to 700 mg a day). [8]\nHeart health\nCaffeine is a stimulant affecting the central nervous system that can cause different reactions in people. In sensitive individuals, it can irritate the stomach, increase anxiety or a jittery feeling, and disrupt sleep. Although many people appreciate the temporary energy boost after drinking an extra cup of coffee, high amounts of caffeine can cause unwanted heart palpitations in some.\nUnfiltered coffee, such as French press and Turkish coffees, contains diterpenes, substances that can raise bad LDL cholesterol and triglycerides. Espresso coffee contains moderate amounts of diterpenes. Filtered coffee (drip-brewed coffee) and instant coffee contain almost no diterpenes as the filtering and processing of these coffee types removes the diterpenes.\nDespite these factors, evidence suggests that drinking coffee regularly may lower the risk of heart disease and stroke:\nAmong 83,076 women in the Nurses\u2019 Health Study, drinking 4 or more cups of coffee each day was associated with a 20% lower risk of stroke compared with non-drinkers. Decaffeinated coffee also showed an association, with 2 or more cups daily and a 11% lower stroke risk. The authors found no such association with other caffeinated drinks such as tea and soda. These coffee-specific results suggest that components in coffee other than caffeine may be protective. [9]\nA large cohort of 37,514 women concluded that moderate coffee drinking of 2-3 cups a day was associated with a 21% reduced risk of heart disease. [10]\nIn addition, a meta-analysis of 21 prospective studies of men and women looking at coffee consumption and death from chronic diseases found a link between moderate coffee consumption (3 cups per day) and a 21% lower risk of cardiovascular disease deaths compared with non-drinkers. [11]\nAnother meta-analysis of 36 studies including men and women reviewed coffee consumption and risk of cardiovascular diseases (including heart disease, stroke, heart failure, and deaths from these conditions). It found that when compared with the lowest intakes of coffee (average 0 cups), a moderate coffee intake of 3-5 cups a day was linked with a 15% lower risk of cardiovascular disease. Heavier coffee intake of 6 or more cups daily was neither associated with a higher nor a lower risk of cardiovascular disease. [12]\nDepression\nNaturally occurring polyphenols in both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee can act as antioxidants to reduce damaging oxidative stress and inflammation of cells. It may have neurological benefits in some people and act as an antidepressant. [13] Caffeine may affect mental states such as increasing alertness and attention, reducing anxiety, and improving mood. [14] A moderate caffeine intake of less than 6 cups of coffee per day has been associated with a lower risk of depression and suicide. However in a few cases of sensitive individuals, higher amounts of caffeine may increase anxiety, restlessness, and insomnia. Suddenly stopping caffeine intake can cause headache, fatigue, anxiety, and low mood for a few days and may persist for up to a week. [15]\nA prospective cohort study following 263,923 participants from the National Institutes of Health and American Association of Retired Persons found that those who drank 4 or more cups of coffee a day were almost 10% less likely to become depressed than those who drank none. [15]\nIn a meta-analysis of observational studies including 330,677 participants, the authors found a 24% reduced risk of depression when comparing the highest (4.5 cups/day) to lowest (<1 cup) intakes of coffee. They found an 8% decreased risk of depression with each additional cup of coffee consumed. There was also a 28% reduced risk of depression comparing the highest to lowest intakes of caffeine, with the greatest benefit occurring with caffeine intakes between 68 and 509 mg a day (about 6 oz. to 2 cups of coffee). [16]\nA review looking at three large prospective cohorts of men and women in the U.S. found a decreasing risk of suicide with increasing coffee consumption. When compared with no-coffee drinkers, the pooled risk of suicide was 45% lower among those who drank 2-3 cups daily and 53% lower among those who drank 4 or more cups daily. There was no association between decaffeinated coffee and suicide risk, suggesting that caffeine was the key factor, rather than plant compounds in coffee. [17]\nNeurodegenerative diseases\nParkinson\u2019s disease (PD) is mainly caused by low dopamine levels. There is consistent evidence from epidemiologic studies that higher consumption of caffeine is associated with lower risk of developing PD. The caffeine in coffee has been found in animal and cell studies to protect cells in the brain that produce dopamine.\nA systematic review of 26 studies including cohort and case-control studies found a 25% lower risk of developing PD with higher intakes of caffeinated coffee. It also found a 24% decreased risk with every 300 mg increase in caffeine intake. [18]\nA Finnish cohort study tracked coffee consumption and PD development in 6,710 men and women over 22 years. In that time, after adjusting for known risks of PD, those who drank at least 10 cups of coffee a day had a significantly lower risk of developing the disease than non-drinkers. [19]\nA large cohort of men and women were followed for 10 and 16 years, respectively, to study caffeine and coffee intake on PD. The results showed an association in men drinking the most caffeine (6 or more cups of coffee daily) and a 58% lower risk of PD compared with men drinking no coffee. Women showed the lowest risk when drinking moderate intakes of 1-3 cups coffee daily. [20]\nAlzheimer\u2019s disease: In the CAIDE (Cardiovascular Risk Factors, Aging and Dementia) study, drinking 3-5 cups of coffee a day at midlife (mean age 50 years) was associated with a significantly decreased risk of Alzheimer\u2019s disease later in life compared with low coffee drinkers after 21 years of follow-up. [2]\nHowever, three systematic reviews were inconclusive about coffee\u2019s effect on Alzheimer\u2019s disease due to a limited number of studies and a high variation in study types that produced mixed findings. Overall the results suggested a trend towards a protective effect of caffeine against late-life dementia and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, but no definitive statements could be made. The authors stated the need for larger studies with longer follow-up periods. Randomized controlled trials studying a protective effect of coffee or caffeine on the progression of Alzheimer\u2019s disease and dementia are not yet available. [21-23]\nGallstones\nThere are various proposed actions of caffeine or components in coffee that may prevent the formation of gallstones. The most common type of gallstone is made of cholesterol. Coffee may prevent cholesterol from forming into crystals in the gallbladder. It may stimulate contractions in the gallbladder and increase the flow of bile so that cholesterol does not collect. [24]\nA study of 46,008 men tracked the development of gallstones and their coffee consumption for 10 years. After adjusting for other factors known to cause gallstones, the study concluded that men who consistently drank coffee were significantly less likely to develop gallstones compared to men who did not. [24] A similar large study found the same result in women. [25]\nMortality\nIn a large cohort of more than 200,000 participants followed for up to 30 years, an association was found between drinking moderate amounts of coffee and lower risk of early death. Compared with non-drinkers, those who drank 3-5 cups of coffee daily were 15% less likely to die early from all causes, including cardiovascular disease, suicide, and Parkinson\u2019s disease. Both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee provided benefits. The authors suggested that bioactive compounds in coffee may be responsible for interfering with disease development by reducing inflammation and insulin resistance. [26]\nIn a large prospective cohort of more than 500,000 people followed for 10 years, an association was found between drinking higher amounts of coffee and lower rates of death from all causes. Compared with non-drinkers, those drinking 6-7 cups daily had a 16% lower risk of early death. [26] A protective association was also found in those who drank 8 or more cups daily. The protective effect was present regardless of a genetic predisposition to either faster or slower caffeine metabolism. Instant and decaffeinated coffee showed a similar health benefit.\nThe bottom line: A large body of evidence suggests that consumption of caffeinated coffee does not increase the risk of cardiovascular diseases and cancers. In fact, consumption of 3 to 5 standard cups of coffee daily has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of several chronic diseases. [4] However, some individuals may not tolerate higher amounts of caffeine due to symptoms of jitteriness, anxiety, and insomnia. Specifically, those who have difficulty controlling their blood pressure may want to moderate their coffee intake. Pregnant women are also advised to aim for less than 200 mg of caffeine daily, the amount in 2 cups of coffee, because caffeine passes through the placenta into the fetus and has been associated with pregnancy loss and low birth weight. [3, 27] Because of the potential negative side effects some people experience when drinking caffeinated coffee, it is not necessary to start drinking it if you do not already or to increase the amount you currently drink, as there are many other dietary strategies to improve your health. Decaffeinated coffee is a good option if one is sensitive to caffeine, and according to the research summarized above, it offers similar health benefits as caffeinated coffee. It\u2019s also important to keep in mind how you enjoy your brew. The extra calories, sugar, and saturated fat in a coffee house beverage loaded with whipped cream and flavored syrup might offset any health benefits found in a basic black coffee.\nWhat about iced coffee?\nTypes\nCoffee beans are the seeds of a fruit called a coffee cherry. Coffee cherries grow on coffee trees from a genus of plants called Coffea. There are a wide variety of species of coffee plants, ranging from shrubs to trees.\nType of bean.There are two main types of coffee species, Arabica and Robusta. Arabica originates from Ethiopia and produces a mild, flavorful tasting coffee. It is the most popular type worldwide. However, it is expensive to grow because the Arabica plant is sensitive to the environment, requiring shade, humidity, and steady temperatures between 60-75 degrees Fahrenheit. The Robusta coffee plant is more economical to grow because it is resistant to disease and survives in a wider range of temperatures between 65-97 degrees Fahrenheit. It can also withstand harsh climate changes such as variations in rainfall and strong sunlight.\nType of roast.Coffee beans start out green. They are roasted at a high heat to produce a chemical change that releases the rich aroma and flavor that we associate with coffee. They are then cooled and ground for brewing. Roasting levels range from light to medium to dark. The lighter the roast, the lighter the color and roasted flavor and the higher its acidity. Dark roasts produce a black bean with little acidity and a bitter roasted flavor. The popular French roast is medium-dark.\nType of grind. A medium grind is the most common and used for automatic drip coffee makers. A fine grind is used for deeper flavors like espresso, which releases the oils, and a coarse grind is used in coffee presses.\nDecaffeinated coffee. This is an option for those who experience unpleasant side effects from caffeine. The two most common methods used to remove caffeine from coffee is to apply chemical solvents (methylene chloride or ethyl acetate) or carbon dioxide gas. Both are applied to steamed or soaked beans, which are then allowed to dry. The solvents bind to caffeine and both evaporate when the beans are rinsed and/or dried. According to U.S. regulations, at least 97% of the caffeine must be removed to carry the decaffeinated label, so there may be trace residual amounts of caffeine. Both methods may cause some loss of flavor as other naturally occurring chemicals in coffee beans that impart their unique flavor and scent may be destroyed during processing.\nWatch out for hidden calories in coffee drinks\nA plain \u201cblack\u201d cup of coffee is a very low calorie drink\u20148 ounces only contains 2 calories! However, adding sugar, cream, and milk can quickly bump up the calorie counts. A tablespoon of cream contains 52 calories, and a tablespoon of whole milk contains 9 calories. While 9 calories isn\u2019t a lot, milk is often poured into coffee without measuring, so you may be getting several servings of milk or cream in your coffee. A tablespoon of sugar contains 48 calories, so if you take your coffee with cream and sugar, you\u2019re adding over 100 extra calories to your daily cup.\nHowever, the real caloric danger occurs in specialty mochas, lattes, or blended ice coffee drinks. These drinks are often super-sized and can contain anywhere from 200-500 calories, as well as an extremely large amount of sugar. With these drinks, it\u2019s best to enjoy them as a treat or dessert, and stick with plain, minimally sweetened coffee on a regular basis\nStore\nPlace beans or ground coffee in an airtight opaque container at room temperature away from sunlight. Inside a cool dark cabinet would be ideal. Exposure to moisture, air, heat, and light can strip coffee of its flavor. Coffee packaging does not preserve the coffee well for extended periods, so transfer larger amounts of coffee to airtight containers.\nCoffee can be frozen if stored in a very airtight container. Exposure to even small amounts of air in the freezer can lead to freezer burn.\nMake\nFollow directions on the coffee package and your coffee machine, but generally the ratio is 1-2 tablespoons of ground coffee per 6 ounces of water.\nFor optimal coffee flavor, drink soon after brewing. The beverage will lose flavor with time.\nUse ground coffee within a few days and whole beans within two weeks.\nDid You Know?\nIt is a myth that darker roasts contain a higher level of caffeine than lighter roasts. Lighter roasts actually have a slightly higher concentration!\nCoffee grinds should not be brewed more than once. Brewed grinds taste bitter and may no longer produce a pleasant coffee flavor.\nWhile water is always the best choice for quenching your thirst, coffee can count towards your daily fluid goals. Although caffeine has a mild diuretic effect, it is offset by the total amount of fluid from the coffee.\nRelated\nCaffeine\nCaffeine is naturally found in the fruit, leaves, and beans of coffee, cacao, and guarana plants.

The health impacts of coffee consumption have been extensively investigated and are associated with lower all-cause mortality, diabetes mellitus, dementia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, cardiovascular disease, and many types of cancer [2,3,4,5,6]. The effects of coffee on mortality and other [...] diseases have been extensively investigated in many countries and in groups of individuals that are both \u201cnormal\u201d or have specific health problems. The results of recent and past studies clearly show the overall health benefits of higher coffee consumption compared to lower consumption; however, there are also many studies that do not correlate and, in some cases, report conflicting results. The reasons for these differences in some cases may be the failure to examine the effects of sex",

      "content": "Which is healthier: Coffee or tea?\nOn call\nQ. I enjoy my morning cups of coffee, but I've read about the health benefits of tea and wonder if tea is a healthier choice?\nA. Many studies have shown that both coffee and tea drinkers may experience health benefits compared to people who don't consume these beverages. However, it's important to note that all these studies are observational, which means we can't say for sure that coffee or tea leads explicitly to better health outcomes.\nHowever, there are plausible reasons why coffee and tea may be connected to health benefits, beginning with caffeine. Studies have focused more on caffeine than the other ingredients in coffee and tea. Results have found that caffeine directly enhances alertness and concentration while combating fatigue. It can also improve athletic performance, most likely related to an increase in adrenal hormone levels and a metabolic energy boost. Caffeine may even elevate mood.\nRegular coffee provides a bigger caffeine punch per ounce compared to tea. That's why most people reach for coffee when they need a stimulant. Generally, an 8-ounce cup of regular coffee contains about 80 to 100 milligrams (mg) of caffeine. The caffeine content in tea varies depending on the kind. For example, green tea has the highest caffeine concentration, 40 to 70 mg per 8-ounce serving. Other teas have less, and many herbal teas contain minimal, if any, caffeine.\nA total daily caffeine intake of up to 400 mg is safe. Most studies examining the link between caffeine consumption and better health outcomes suggest that 300 mg daily is the sweet spot. However, even much smaller amounts of caffeine make some people jittery or anxious or disrupt sleep.\nBoth beverages are also rich in antioxidants like polyphenols, which help reduce chronic inflammation and neutralize cell-damaging free radicals. Green and black tea tend to have higher polyphenol content than other teas and are close to the high antioxidant amounts in coffee.\nCoffee drinking is associated with a host of health benefits, including less heart disease, type 2 diabetes, fatty liver, depression, and cognitive decline. Regular coffee consumption is also linked to longer life.\nBecause of the variety of teas, there are fewer documented health benefits. However, a large observational study published online Sept. 17, 2024, by The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism found that drinking 200 to 300 mg of caffeinated tea or coffee per day was linked to a lower risk of diabetes, coronary artery disease, and stroke. From a health standpoint, there is no reason to change from coffee to tea. But you might enjoy sampling some caffeinated teas to add some variety to your morning beverage.\nImage: \u00a9 tiverylucky/Getty Images\nAbout the Author\nHoward E.

      "content": "Moderate coffee drinking \u2014 about three to five cups a day \u2014 has been previously linked to reduced risks for dying early. A new study suggests that when people drink coffee could factor into these observed benefits. The researchers found that adults who drank coffee before noon saw the greatest reductions in dying early from any cause and from cardiovascular disease.\nFor this analysis, the investigators assessed nutrition data collected from more than 40,000 U.S. adults who participated in a long-term nutrition study. About half of participants, 52%, drank coffee. More than one-third, 36%, drank coffee in the morning. The rest, 16%, drank coffee throughout the day. After controlling for a variety of factors, the researchers found that adults who limited their coffee consumption to between 4 a.m. and noon were 16% less likely to die from any cause throughout nearly 10 years compared to adults who didn\u2019t drink coffee. They were also 31% less likely to die from cardiovascular disease. These associations didn\u2019t extend to people who drank coffee throughout the day.\nThe researchers believe the benefits of drinking coffee in the morning may be due to two factors. First, drinking coffee with caffeine early in the day as opposed to in the afternoon or evening is less likely to alter a person\u2019s sleep patterns, which supports their overall and cardiovascular health. Second, the anti-inflammatory effects of coffee, whether it\u2019s caffeinated or not, may be strongest in the morning since this is when levels of inflammation can peak. The authors note more research is needed to study these and other associations linked to coffee\u2019s health benefits.\nThe findings from this study published in the European Society of Cardiology. The research was supported by NHLBI and the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.",
