The other surveyed cities\u2014Chennai, Hyderabad, Kolkata, and Pune\u2014offer accommodation costs that are over 50% lower than Mumbai. Among these cities, Kolkata claims the lowest cost of expatriate accommodation, providing a more affordable option for residents and expatriates.\nThe current macro-economic landscape has spurred organizations to reassess their global mobility programs with a focus on employee experience, balanced with economics. It is also implying a closer monitoring of specific factors such as currency fluctuations, cost inflation for goods and services, and instability of accommodation prices that are essential to determining the cost of expatriate packages for employees on international assignments.\nMercer\u2019s Cost of Living survey is one of the most recognized and comprehensive of its kind, helping international employers design efficient and equitable compensation packages for over 400 assignment locations worldwide.\nThis year\u2019s ranking includes 227 cities from across five continents. It measures the comparative cost of more than 200 items in each location, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods and entertainment. The data collected provides all of the key information employers need to design efficient and transparent compensation packages for international assignees.\nMumbai & Delhi rank among the top 35 most expensive cities in Asia for expatriates, among those surveyed in 2023. However, Mumbai moves down one spot within Asian cities, to 27th position from previous year (2022).\nBased on the most recent findings, rental prices have shown an upward trend across all surveyed Indian cities. Mumbai stands out with the most significant surge, witnessing an increase of 13-15% compared to 2022. In other surveyed cities such as Bangalore, New Delhi, Pune, and Chennai, housing rentals have seen a rise ranging from 5-7%. However, Hyderabad and Kolkata experienced comparatively modest increases, with rental prices going up by approximately 2-3%.\nRahul Sharma, India Mobility Leader, Mercer said, \"We have observed a change in the relative positioning of Indian cities in the global ranking, which can be attributed to multiple factors. In particular, the shifting order is partly influenced by currency volatility and the inflationary increase in prices of goods and services in other regions, such as Europe, that has played a role in pushing down the overall rankings of Indian cities.\nThe latest survey findings reveal noteworthy cost trends across surveyed locations in India. The cost of essential food items at home, including fruits, vegetables, milk, and dairy products, has risen across all cities, with Kolkata and Pune being the most budget-friendly options. Meanwhile, Bangalore, Chennai, and Hyderabad have experienced an increase in alcohol prices, with Chennai having the highest prices in this category. Personal care expenses have increased in all cities, with Mumbai being the most expensive and Kolkata offering more affordable options.\nAdditionally, utilities such as electricity and internet/broadband have seen an upward trend in most surveyed Indian cities. Finally, Delhi and Mumbai have the highest costs for dining out, while Pune provides the most economical options, followed by Bangalore and Hyderabad.\nHowever, Indian cities, such as Mumbai (147) and Delhi (169), offer a cost-efficient destination for global multinational corporations (MNCs) looking to set up operations overseas, with lower cost of living and expat accommodation costs compared to major cities in the Asia Pacific region like Shanghai, Beijing, and Tokyo.\nDespite external challenges, the Indian economy remains highly resilient and is one of the fastest-growing markets globally. In March 2023, India's annual consumer inflation dropped to 5.66%, the lowest since December 2021. Vibrant financial activity, supported by government investments, and robust private consumption, especially among high-income earners, contribute to the positive economic landscape.\nAbout Mercer\u2019s Cost of Living Survey\nMercer's widely recognized Cost of Living ranking is one of the world\u2019s most comprehensive studies and is designed to help multinational companies and governments determine compensation strategies for their international assignees. New York City is used as the base city for all city ranking comparisons and currency movements are measured against the US dollar.\nThe survey includes 400+ cities throughout the world; this year\u2019s ranking includes 227 cities across five continents and measures the comparative cost of more than 200 items in each location, including housing, transportation, food, clothing, household goods, and entertainment.

The country offers a wide variety of regionally distinctive food, traditions, ancient history and vibrant cities with booming tech industries. Visitors can enjoy the stimulating and lively pace of life along with a cost of living in India 82% lower on average than in the United States.\nHome to a variety of international cities with large expatriate populations and excellent schools, India can be a satisfying option for anyone looking for an affordable life in Asia. However, choosing a city that fits your financial needs will help ensure your comfort in this rapidly growing and changing country.\nAll prices in rupees have been converted to U.S. dollars. The data for the cost of living in India comes from Numbeo. These prices were up to date as of November 2024.\nWhat Are the Most Expensive and Cheapest Places to Live in India?\nIndia\u2019s 28 states and eight union territories cover a massive range of geographic features. These include coastal beaches, fertile plains and parts of the Himalayas. The cities can vary as much as the landscape itself. They range from pricier hectic modern metropolises to cheaper, lush, bohemian cities with laid-back vibes.\nMost Expensive Cities in India\nLike most countries, the cost of living in India is higher in the biggest cities. For the extra cost, you get access to more amenities, entertainment and employment opportunities. Space might be the only limited commodity since some of the most expensive cities in India are also the most densely populated. Mumbai has the most expensive rent in India, yet rent is still 81% lower on average than New York City. The cities that come next on the list are significantly cheaper.\n- Mumbai: Known as the \u201cCity of Dreams,\u201d coastal Mumbai is often referred to on the international stage as the New York City of India. It is the country\u2019s most expensive city and its financial and commercial capital. It\u2019s also the home of the famous Bollywood film industry.\n- Gurugram (formerly Gurgaon, also known as Hidayatpur): This northern Indian city just southwest of New Delhi has a lot in common with Mumbai but on a smaller scale. Gurugram is also a technology and financial center and is known for its giant live entertainment complex, \u201cKingdom of Dreams.\u201d The city has also become an established destination for medical tourism.\n- Navi Mumbai: Just east of the Mumbai peninsula, Navi Mumbai is an intentionally planned coastal city known for its lush gardens. With less traffic and air pollution, and lower population density than its neighbor, it makes a worthy rival for the \u201cCity of Dreams.\u201d Navi Mumbai is also a bit more affordable, with rent 91% lower on average than New York.\n- Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore): The technology industry looms large in the southern city of Bengaluru, but so does its green space. Known as much for its parks as its nightlife, there is something for everyone in Bengaluru. According to Numbeo, Bengaluru also offers the highest local purchasing power in India, with rent 92.5% lower on average than New York.\n- Delhi (containing New Delhi): India\u2019s National Capital Territory is a dense and sprawling metropolis of more than 32 million people with local markets and history around every corner. New Delhi is the capital city housed within the territory and home to the Indian government. If you need to escape the crowds, Delhi is also a train hub making it easy to explore the rest of India.\nCheapest Cities in India\nTo live in the cheapest cities in India, you might sacrifice some of the big city atmosphere. What you gain, however, is access to more natural beauty and a calmer way of life with lower population density. For instance, Mumbai has more than 20.9 million people, while Bhopal has just 2.5 million.\n- Bhopal: Known as one of the greenest cities in India, Bhopal is also the cheapest. Its natural surroundings in central India include two mountain lakes and a national park teeming with local wildlife \u2014 including tigers. Rent in Bhopal is 96% lower on average than in New York City and 86% lower on average than in Mumbai.\n- Vadodara (also known as Baroda): Vadodara is known as a green city, with manicured gardens and parks throughout. It is also home to one of the top universities in Asia: Maharaja Sayaji Rao Gaekwad University. This smaller college city offers a relaxed atmosphere.\n- Kochi (also known as Cochin): This southwest coastal city has been a port since the 14th century. Its culture reflects its history. Nicknamed Queen of the Arabian Sea, Kochi has been influenced by cultures across Asia and the Middle East, and life revolves around the glittering harbor.\n- Kolkata (formerly Calcutta): Often associated with Mother Teresa\u2019s charity work, Kolkata offers many colorful annual festivals, impressive colonial architecture and art museums. Investments in infrastructure have improved the quality of life in recent years.\n- Chennai (formerly known as Madras): On the southeastern coast, the city of Chennai has become a hub of automobile manufacturers, earning the new nickname the Detroit of India. Its growing technology sector is also making it a popular choice for expats. According to Numbeo, residents enjoy a high safety and health care index with higher local purchasing power than the cheapest cities of Bhopal and Vadodara. Rent in Chennai is 94% lower on average than in New York City and 68% lower on average than in Mumbai.\nThe Average Cost of Living in India\nHousing Costs in India\nThe geography, religions, festivals, industries and former colonial influences in India can make living in one place vastly different from another. What most Indian cities have in common is high population density and low cost of living.\nWhen compared to U.S. cities, even the most expensive Indian cities are dramatically more affordable. While the difference in cost between the most popular cities is minimal, Mumbai stands out as the most expensive for cost of living in India, including rent. Keep in mind that choosing to live just outside most cities will reduce rental costs. For example, living outside Mumbai may reduce the cost of rent by about 40-45%.\nIf you are a digital nomad or expat planning to work from home, you\u2019ll be pleased to know that the cost of internet in India is low and relatively uniform across the largest cities.

But you are sure to expand your horizons with its broad diversity of flavors, spices, and regional specialties. The best part? Great food and an evening out on the town won\u2019t cost much.\nThe metropolises of Mumbai, Bengaluru and Delhi stand out as more expensive in this category.

These flavorful dishes and more can be bought cheaply at the numerous roadside food stalls, which don\u2019t require tipping, meaning you don\u2019t have to skimp on taste to eat affordably in a big city.\nJust grabbing a drink before heading to the movies? A pint of domestic beer on draught, such as Kingfisher, will cost you USD$1.64-$2, and you\u2019ll spend USD$3.30-$4 on average for a movie ticket to catch the latest international release.\nGroceries are also affordable, another part of the low cost of living in India. A pound of white rice will cost you USD$0.28-$0.34 and a pound of potatoes just USD$0.16-$0.20. Add some chickpeas and ingredients for a curry sauce, and you can enjoy a homemade channa aloo on a night in for barely a dollar.\nWith so much delicious food available, you may want to take extra care of your health. Going for a run in a densely crowded and congested city may not sound appealing, but luckily one month of a fitness club membership costs just USD$17-$21 on average.\nTransportation Costs in India\nIn a country of over a billion people, you can expect busy streets and crowded public transportation systems to be the norm. Despite the crowds, using buses and trains is often the best way to get around any Indian city. Mumbai, in particular, is known for its highly efficient local train system, which only stops running between 1-4 a.m.\nOn average in India, a one-way ticket on local transport will cost you just USD$0.27-$0.33, while a monthly pass will cost USD$9-$11. Of course, these prices vary by city. The price of a monthly pass is below the national average in Mumbai and toward the higher end of the range in New Delhi.\nThe heavy and hectic traffic on roads in Indian cities is notorious. Because of this, many foreigners opt not to drive and instead hire taxis as needed. Taxis are affordable, with the base fare averaging USD$0.60-$0.70. Even if you need a taxi to wait for you for an hour, you\u2019ll only pay an additional USD$1.10-$1.40. Rickshaws are also an option for shorter distances and are even cheaper than taxis.\nHealthcare Costs in India\nIndia\u2019s universal healthcare system (Ayushman Bharat) provides basic care to its large population with unfortunate disparities depending on social class, gender, and location. Access is slowly increasing after an investment in establishing approximately 150,000 health and wellness centers across the country.\nAlso read: Understanding India\u2019s Healthcare System\nUnless you are an Indian citizen, foreigners do not qualify for the country\u2019s public healthcare system and will have to pay out of pocket for care. However, the cost of care is low, and a simple or minor health issue may only cost a few dollars.\nSadly, the standard of care at public hospitals in India is often subpar. To avoid a poor experience, most expatriatess \u2014 and about 36% of Indians \u2014 purchase private health insurance that allows them to be seen at private facilities, including the best hospitals in India. When needed, these private clinics and hospitals may reduce your wait time and improve your overall patient experience.\nAlso read: Health Insurance in India for Foreigners\nIndia Offers Excitement and New Experiences for Less\nWith 40 UNESCO Heritage sites, stunning cultural and geographic diversity, and multiple modern cities to choose from, any expatriate can affordably enjoy all this vibrant South Asian country has to offer.\nDeciding where to live in India requires thoughtful consideration. What you sacrifice in cost and space in the giant metropolises, you\u2019ll make up for in access to amenities and entertainment. A smaller city can significantly reduce costs while bringing you closer to nature.\nBustling Mumbai is the most expensive city in India. But it still doesn\u2019t come close to the cost of the most expensive American city. If you\u2019re looking to avoid the crowds and enjoy a calmer city culture with the lowest cost of living, smaller cities like Vadodara or Chennai should be on your list.\nThe difference in the cost of living in India vs. the U.S. is tremendous. Most expats and digital nomads will find their paycheck goes far in India \u2013 even in the more expensive cities. Wherever you land, India holds a treasure trove of experiences for all of the senses\u2026and easily fits a tight budget.\nRelated:",

The cost of living is calculated based on different measures such as the consumer price index (CPI), living cost indexes, and wage price index. CPI refers to the change in the value of consumer goods and services. The wage price index, on the other hand, measures the change in labor services prices due to market pressures. Lastly, the living cost indexes calculate the impact of changing costs on different households. The relationship between wages and costs determines affordability and shifts in the cost of living.\nMumbai tops the list\nMumbai usually tops the list of most expensive cities in India. As the financial and entertainment hub of the country, Mumbai offers wide opportunities and attracts talent from all over the country. It is the second-largest city in India and has one of the most expensive real estates in the world.\nProfit from the additional features of your individual account\nCurrently, you are using a shared account.
