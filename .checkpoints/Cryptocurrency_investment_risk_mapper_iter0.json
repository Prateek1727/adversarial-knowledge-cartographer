      "content": "Tips for managing risk in crypto investments\nAuthor: Brad Anderson\nSource: ReadWrite\nCryptocurrency investments have gained significant popularity recently, attracting many investors seeking lucrative opportunities. However, with this increasing popularity comes inherent risks that must be effectively managed.\nConduct thorough research\nTo navigate the cryptocurrency market successfully, it is crucial to dedicate time and effort to comprehensive research. Begin by understanding different cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology.\nInvestigate various cryptocurrencies\u2019 market trends and historical performance, allowing you to assess their potential.\nDelve into the company behind a particular cryptocurrency project to evaluate their credibility and expertise. Consider regulatory frameworks and legal considerations that may impact your investments.\nDiversify your portfolio\nDiversification is a fundamental principle of investment risk management, and it applies equally to cryptocurrencies. By spreading your investments across different cryptocurrencies, you can mitigate the risk associated with individual assets.\nDiversifying within the crypto space involves including different types of crypto assets, such as coins, tokens, and stablecoins. This diversification strategy can help balance risk and potential returns, safeguarding your portfolio against significant losses.\nSet realistic goals and risk tolerance\nDefine your investment objectives and time horizon before entering the crypto market. Assess your personal risk tolerance and comfort level with volatility. Understanding these factors will help you align your investment strategy with your goals and risk appetite.\nStay informed and updated\nThe cryptocurrency market is highly dynamic and influenced by various factors, including news and market developments. Stay informed by following reliable sources of information and analysis. Subscribe to newsletters, join online communities, and participate in forums to gain insights into the latest market trends and potential opportunities.\nMonitor regulatory changes, as they can significantly impact the cryptocurrency landscape.\nSecure your investments\nEnsuring the security of your crypto investments is paramount in the face of increasing cyber threats. Choose reputable and secure cryptocurrency exchanges to conduct your transactions.\nImplement strong security measures such as two-factor authentication and consider utilizing hardware wallets to store your digital assets offline. Be vigilant about phishing attempts and scams, and never disclose your private keys or sensitive information to unauthorized sources.\nUse stop loss orders and take profits\nTo protect your investments from sudden market downturns, consider setting up stop-loss orders. These orders automatically sell a cryptocurrency if it reaches a predetermined price, limiting potential losses.\nSimilarly, take-profit orders can be utilized to secure profits by selling a cryptocurrency when it reaches a specific price target. Regularly review and adjust these orders based on market conditions to optimize your risk management strategy.\nAvoid emotional decision-making\nThe cryptocurrency market is notorious for its volatility, often leading to emotional highs and lows. It is crucial to be aware of the influence of emotions on investment decisions and develop a disciplined and rational approach to investing. Avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations and focus on long-term trends and fundamental analysis.\nConsider long-term investing\nWhile the allure of quick profits may be tempting, it is essential to recognize the volatile nature of the cryptocurrency market. Consider adopting a long-term investment strategy that focuses on fundamental analysis and the viability of the cryptocurrency project.\nSeek professional advice if needed\nIf you are unsure about navigating the complexities of cryptocurrency investments, it may be prudent to seek professional advice. Consult with financial advisors or experts in the field who deeply understand the crypto market.\nThey can provide guidance tailored to your needs and help you make well-informed investment decisions. Alternatively, consider professional portfolio management services that specialize in cryptocurrency investments.\nWhat are the fundamental risks in crypto investments: A must-know for beginners and experts\nEngaging in cryptocurrency investments offers exciting opportunities, but it is equally crucial to understand and be aware of the fundamental risks associated with this volatile market. Both beginners and experts must recognize and assess these risks to make informed investment decisions.\n- Volatility and Market Fluctuations: One of the most prominent risks in crypto investments is the high volatility and rapid market fluctuations. Cryptocurrencies can experience significant price swings within short periods, making them susceptible to sudden market crashes. Beginners and experts alike must understand that substantial gains can be swiftly offset by substantial losses, requiring caution and careful risk management.\n- Regulatory and Legal Uncertainty: Crypto investments are subject to an evolving regulatory landscape that varies across different jurisdictions. Governments and regulatory bodies worldwide are still defining their stance on cryptocurrencies, resulting in uncertainty and potential legal risks. Changes in regulations or the introduction of restrictive policies can impact the value and usability of cryptocurrencies. Both beginners and experts should stay updated with regulatory developments and ensure compliance to avoid legal complications.\n- Cybersecurity and Hacking Risks: The decentralized nature of cryptocurrencies, while providing advantages, also exposes investors to cybersecurity risks. Hackers target exchanges, wallets, and other crypto-related platforms, aiming to steal digital assets. Beginners and experts must adopt robust security measures, such as using hardware wallets, two-factor authentication, and reputable platforms, to safeguard their investments. Neglecting cybersecurity practices can lead to devastating losses.\n- Technology and Project Risks: Crypto investments often involve supporting specific blockchain projects or cryptocurrencies. However, not all projects are equally reliable or successful. Some projects may lack a solid foundation, competent teams, or disruptive technology, increasing the risk of failure or loss of investment. Beginners and experts must conduct thorough research, analyze project fundamentals, and evaluate the team\u2019s credibility and technological advancements before committing funds to any project.\n- Liquidity Risks: Liquidity risk refers to the ability to buy or sell cryptocurrencies quickly without significantly impacting their market price. Some lesser-known or illiquid cryptocurrencies may face challenges in finding buyers or sellers, leading to liquidity issues. Beginners and experts should be cautious when investing in low-cap or less popular cryptocurrencies, as exiting positions during market downturns can be difficult or result in substantial losses.\nThis article was written by Brad Anderson from ReadWrite and was legally licensed through the DiveMarketplace by Industry Dive.

      "content": "Austin Werner Blog\n13.3.2025\n|\nEssential crypto risk management strategies to protect your digital assets and maximize growth. Navigate the complexities of cryptocurrency investing.\nThe cryptocurrency market presents exceptional growth opportunities, but it also carries significant risks that can quickly impact your investments. Price volatility, security vulnerabilities, and evolving regulations make risk management in crypto a crucial practice for anyone aiming to thrive in this fast-moving space.\nWhether you're an individual investor or managing a large institutional portfolio, implementing solid risk management strategies can mean the difference between substantial gains and devastating losses.\nAt Austin Werner, we understand what risk management in crypto is and its importance for innovative web3 and crypto organizations. We specialize in partnering with these companies to connect them with top talent, helping build strong teams that can navigate the rapidly evolving digital asset landscape and drive growth in 2025 and beyond.\nRisk management in crypto is a systematic process for identifying, assessing, and mitigating threats to your digital asset investments. The cryptocurrency market is highly volatile, with prices often shifting dramatically in minutes or hours. Without effective risk management protocols, traders and investors risk significant losses.\nEffective crypto risk management involves:\nRisk identification: Recognizing key risks such as market volatility, security breaches, and regulatory changes.\nRisk assessment: Evaluating the likelihood and potential impact of identified risks.\nRisk mitigation: Applying strategies like diversification, position sizing, and enhanced security measures.\nContinuous monitoring: Regularly reviewing and adapting your approach as market conditions evolve.\nA crypto risk manager oversees this process and makes sure that strong protocols protect your digital assets while supporting growth opportunities.\nCryptocurrency prices can experience significant fluctuations driven by news events, market sentiment, or large transactions. Unlike traditional financial markets, which have circuit breakers and other stabilizing tools, crypto markets operate 24/7 with fewer safeguards.\nFor example, in 2021, Bitcoin fell from around $64,000 to $30,000 in just a few weeks, wiping out billions in market value. Investors without effective risk management faced substantial losses during this time.\nThe cryptocurrency space remains a prime target for hackers and scammers. Reports suggest that billions of dollars may be lost yearly due to crypto-related thefts.\nCommon attack methods include phishing attacks targeting exchange credentials, malware aimed at stealing wallet private keys, exchange hacks resulting in large fund losses, and smart contract vulnerabilities that can be exploited in DeFi protocols. Without strong security measures, your crypto holdings remain vulnerable, regardless of market performance.\nGovernment policies on cryptocurrencies differ widely across regions and continue to evolve rapidly. Sudden regulatory shifts can heavily influence market prices and even the legality of some crypto activities. For example, announcements of bans or restrictions often trigger sharp market sell-offs, while positive developments, like the approval of Bitcoin ETFs in the US, can lead to significant rallies.\nOne of the most fundamental risk management strategies in crypto is diversification. By spreading your investments across multiple cryptocurrencies, you reduce exposure to single-point failures. An effective diversification strategy includes allocating assets across:\nLarge-cap cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum.\nMid-cap altcoins with strong fundamentals and growth potential.\nStablecoins to help preserve capital during market downturns.\nTokens from diverse sectors such as DeFi, NFTs, and layer-1 protocols to spread exposure across different market themes.\nWe connect clients with experts in the crypto space who understands portfolio diversification best practices.\nPosition sizing is a crucial technique for managing risk in crypto markets, which involves deciding how much of your capital to allocate to each investment. A commonly followed rule is to risk only a small percentage (typically 1-3%) of your total portfolio on any one trade.\nFor example, with a $10,000 portfolio and a 2% limit, you would risk no more than $200 on a single position. This approach ensures that no single failed trade can significantly impact your overall portfolio.\nA stop-loss order automatically sells your cryptocurrency once it hits a predetermined price that helps to limit potential losses during market downturns. This tool is essential in crypto, given its 24/7 trading and rapid price swings.\nFor instance, if you buy Bitcoin at $50,000, you might set a stop-loss at $45,000 (a 10% drop). If the price falls to this level, the order triggers automatically, helping to prevent further losses. Many experienced traders recommend setting stop-losses at key technical support levels rather than arbitrary percentages to avoid being stopped out during normal market fluctuations.\nHedging helps offset potential losses in your primary investments through various techniques:\nFutures contracts: Taking short positions to capitalize on price declines.\nOptions: Buying put options that gain value as prices fall.\nStablecoins: Converting portions of your portfolio into stablecoins during uncertain market periods to preserve capital.\nInverse tokens: Using tokens designed to move opposite to the underlying asset\u2019s price.\nThese strategies provide protection during market downturns while allowing you to maintain exposure to upside potential.\nRobust security is a vital part of effective crypto risk management. Industry experts recommend:\nHardware wallets: Store the majority of your holdings offline in cold storage devices disconnected from the internet.\nMulti-factor authentication (2FA): Add extra security layers on all exchange accounts and wallets.\nUnique, strong passwords: Use complex, different passwords for each platform.\nRegular security audits: Periodically review your access points and update your security measures.\nWhitelisting: Restrict withdrawals to pre-approved addresses only.\nRemember, even the most profitable investment strategy is only as strong as the security that protects it.\nModern technology brings a range of powerful tools to strengthen your risk management approach in the crypto space:\nPortfolio trackers offer real-time monitoring of your investments across multiple platforms, helping you stay on top of your risk exposure. Leading options include CoinTracker, CoinStats, Delta, and FTX (formerly Blockfolio).\nThese platforms can notify you about significant price changes and help you measure performance against your investment goals.\nAutomated trading tools can execute predefined strategies without emotional bias, providing a significant advantage in managing crypto risks. These systems can:\nAutomatically execute stop-loss and take-profit orders\nApply dollar-cost averaging strategies\nRebalance your portfolio to maintain target allocations\nCarry out complex trading strategies using technical indicators\nWhile automated tools can enhance your risk management, it\u2019s important to thoroughly test and regularly monitor them.\nOn-chain analytics platforms deliver insights into blockchain activity that can inform your risk management decisions. These tools analyze:\nLarge transactions (\u201cwhale\u201d movements)\nNetwork activity and usage patterns\nSmart contract interactions and potential vulnerabilities\nToken distribution and holder concentration\nAccess to this data helps you spot possible risks before they affect market prices.\nA crypto risk manager focuses on identifying, assessing, and reducing risks related to digital asset investments. With more institutional players entering the crypto space, their expertise is crucial for helping clients navigate market risks, develop risk management frameworks, and maintain strong security protocols.\nThey also ensure compliance with evolving regulations and prepare contingency plans for different scenarios. Through our recruitment services, Austin Werner helps crypto companies hire skilled professionals who can manage risks and navigate market complexities.\nExchanges face many risks such as security breaches, liquidity challenges during volatile periods, regulatory compliance, and market manipulation attempts.

      "content": "By Constantinos A Nicolaides, Senior Manager, PwC Cyprus Fund Services\nCryptocurrencies have garnered significant attention since their introduction to the broader financial world, and they are expected to remain a prominent topic of interest and controversy for years to come. As the popularity of digital currencies, like Bitcoin and Ethereum, continues to expand, so does the interest in investing in them. Similarly, cryptocurrency funds have gained popularity as a way for both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to the world of digital currencies without the complexities of direct ownership. In recent months, some of the world's most renowned investment firms, including BlackRock, Fidelity, and Invesco have applied for permission to launch their own Bitcoin funds. Meanwhile, Grayscale Investments LLC, after initial setbacks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, has just recently received court approval to launch a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\nThe participation of these giants in the cryptocurrency space signals partial institutional acceptance and growth recognition of digital assets. However, like any investment, cryptocurrency funds come with their own set of risks. Investing in a cryptocurrency fund can offer several opportunities, although it is essential to remember that these opportunities come with their own set of risks. This article explores the potential opportunities and risks associated with cryptocurrency funds as a means of cautioning investors.\nOpportunities for Investors\nBefore delving into the risks, let us first understand what cryptocurrency funds are and what they have to offer. Cryptocurrency funds are investment vehicles that pool money from multiple investors to invest in a single cryptocurrency (i.e. Bitcoin ETF) or a portfolio of cryptocurrencies. These funds can take various forms, including hedge funds, mutual funds, ETFs, and private investment funds. Investors are drawn to cryptocurrency funds for several reasons, which are further analyzed below:\n- Diversification: Multi-currency cryptocurrency funds can offer diversification through spreading risk across a range of cryptocurrencies, rather than relying on a single coin, potentially improving returns.\n- Professional Management: Investment in a cryptocurrency fund is usually managed by experienced managers who specialize in the cryptocurrency markets and this allows investors to leverage their in-depth knowledge, risk mitigation practices and professional research.\n- Risk Mitigation: Some cryptocurrency funds employ risk management strategies to protect investors from extreme market volatility. These strategies may include stop-loss orders, hedging, risk limit placement and asset allocation techniques.\n- Access to Emerging Assets: Cryptocurrency funds provide access to emerging digital assets and blockchain projects that may not be readily available to retail investors. This access can be useful in getting in on the ground floor of innovative technologies and projects.\n- Liquidity: Unlike direct investments in cryptocurrencies, which may be challenging to buy or sell quickly, publicly traded cryptocurrency funds can offer better or more secure liquidity. This means that investors can enter and exit their investment more easily, which can be crucial in a volatile market. Although liquidity is described as an opportunity, liquidity risk may also arise. This is further analyzed in the next section.\n- Compliance Framework: Many cryptocurrency funds and their managers operate within a regulated framework. This means that, amongst other things, they have to abide by high standards of corporate governance, employ experienced risk managers and possibly meet adequate liquidity ratios. Operating within a regulated framework may provide some investors with a sense of security and assurance that their investments comply with relevant laws and regulations.\n- Convenience: Investing in a cryptocurrency fund is often more convenient than managing a portfolio of digital assets by oneself. Entrusting wealth in a professional asset manager can save time and effort which would be required for research and trade execution.\nRisks Associated with Cryptocurrency Funds\nAs a volatile and relatively new product, the underlying asset of cryptocurrencies comes with a variety of inherent risks, as stated below.\n- Market Volatility: Cryptocurrency markets are notorious for their extreme volatility. Prices can skyrocket and plummet within short periods. While diversification can help mitigate some of this risk, cryptocurrency funds are still subject to the overall crypto market's wild swings. Investors should, therefore, be prepared for significant price fluctuations.\n- Regulatory Uncertainty: Cryptocurrencies exist within an uncharted regulatory area in many countries. The regulatory landscape is continually evolving, with governments worldwide grappling with how to classify digital assets. The recent allegations by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission against Coinbase is notable. The SEC is accusing Coinbase of potential violations of federal securities laws and the controversy between the two on whether cryptocurrencies meet the criteria for being classified as securities is ongoing. Such uncertainty may result in abrupt regulatory changes that may impact the functioning of cryptocurrency funds.\n- Tax Implications: Similarly to regulatory uncertainty, cryptocurrency taxation can be complex and varies from one jurisdiction to another. Often, a country\u2019s tax framework may lack clarity on how cryptocurrencies are treated, and legislative updates may introduce unexpected tax obligations. Investing in a cryptocurrency fund may involve tax implications that investors should carefully consider and be prepared for.\n- Custody Risks: Although cryptocurrency funds provide a convenient way to invest, they are not immune to custody risks. In the context of cryptocurrencies, custody risk is significant because these digital assets are stored in digital wallets. Relevant situations include hacking of digital wallets and cyberattacks, misplacement and loss of access.\n- Counterparty Risk: Many cryptocurrency funds rely on third-party service providers, such as custodians and exchange platforms. If one of these service providers defaults or experiences financial problems, it can impact the fund's operations and the security of investors' assets. Transparency with respect to the network of the fund\u2019s service providers should be sought and investigation of their credibility should be performed.\n- Liquidity Risk: Liquidity in the cryptocurrency market can be sporadic. When there's a surge in demand to withdraw funds from a cryptocurrency fund, the fund may not be able to meet these redemption requests immediately. This can lead to delays and give rise to an opportunity cost for investors.\n- Pump and Dump Schemes: The cryptocurrency market is not immune to fraudulent activities. Bad actors may manipulate the prices of certain cryptocurrencies or tokens at the expense of other investors.\nHow to Mitigate Risks\nWhile cryptocurrency funds come with inherent risks, investors can take steps to mitigate these challenges, when considering an investment in a cryptocurrency fund:\n- Diversify: Choose cryptocurrency funds that offer a diversified portfolio of assets. Diversification can help spread risk across different cryptocurrencies and reduce the impact of a single asset's poor performance.\n- Research: Conduct thorough research on the fund's managers, their track record and the fund's investment strategy. Investors should seek transparency in the fund\u2019s reporting and operations and seek clarifications in relation to risk management and mitigation techniques before investing.\n- Due Diligence: Understand the fund's security measures and how they protect digital assets. Ensure that they use reputable custodians and follow best practices in terms of security.\n- Stay Informed: Keep abreast of regulatory and tax developments. This will help investors to anticipate potential changes that could affect their investments and consider whether liquidating their position proactively benefit them.\n- Liquidity Assessment: Assess the fund's liquidity terms and redemption policies. Understand how quickly a redemption request can be settled.\n- Tax Planning: Consult with tax professionals who are well-versed in cryptocurrency taxation to ensure compliance with tax laws and tax optimization.\n- Remain vigilant: Investors should not invest blindly due to fear of missing out (FOMO) or due to the impression of an easy win. Instead, they should make informed decisions based, among other factors, on their individual financial objectives and risk tolerance.\nConclusion\nCryptocurrency funds offer a potentially enticing opportunity to invest in the rapidly evolving world of digital assets. However, it's essential to approach these investments with caution and a clear understanding of the associated risks. By conducting thorough research, diversifying their own investments, and staying informed about the evolving cryptocurrency landscape, investors can better navigate the risks associated with cryptocurrency funds. Most importantly, investors should remember that, like any investment, the decision to invest in cryptocurrency funds should align with their financial goals and risk tolerance. As the cryptocurrency market continues to mature, investors will likely see improvements in risk management and regulatory clarity, which may make this asset class more accessible and secure.",

Learn about our editorial policies Definition Cryptocurrencies are digital assets created using blockchain technology. What Is Cryptocurrency? A cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency secured by cryptography, which makes it nearly impossible to counterfeit or double-spend. Cryptocurrencies exist on decentralized networks that utilize blockchain technology\u2014a distributed ledger secured by a network of computers. A defining feature of cryptocurrencies is that they are generally not issued by any central or governing authority. However, laws and policies set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) have placed policies and standards that must be abided by institutions, such as crypto exchanges and online brokerage firms that offer cryptocurrency. Key Takeaways A cryptocurrency is a form of digital asset based on a blockchain network that is distributed across a large number of computers. This decentralized structure allows them to exist outside the control of governments and central authorities. Government agencies such as the SEC routinely regulate cryptocurrency, setting laws and regulations for crypto exchanges and online brokerage firms to follow. Some experts believe blockchain and related technologies will disrupt many industries, including finance and law. The advantages of cryptocurrencies include cheaper and faster money transfers, as well as the possibility of capital gains. The disadvantages of cryptocurrencies include their price volatility, high energy consumption for mining activities, and use in criminal activities. Investopedia / Tara Anand Understanding Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies are digital currencies underpinned by cryptographic systems. They enable secure online payments without the use of third-party intermediaries. \"Crypto\" refers to the various encryption algorithms and cryptographic techniques that safeguard these entries, such as elliptic curve encryption, public-private key pairs, and hashing functions. Blockchain technology is central to the appeal and functionality of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. As its name indicates, a blockchain is essentially a set of connected blocks of information on an online ledger. Each block contains a set of transactions that have been verified by validators on a network. This network-wide validation makes it nearly impossible to forge transactions. The contents of the online ledger must be agreed upon by a network of individual nodes, or computers that maintain the ledger. Experts say that blockchain technology can serve multiple industries, supply chains, and processes, such as online voting and crowdfunding. For example, financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) have developed and utilized blockchain technology to reduce transaction costs by streamlining payment processing. Types of Cryptocurrency Many cryptocurrencies were created to facilitate work done on the blockchain they are built on. For example, Ethereum's native digital coin, Ether (ETH), was designed to be used as payment for validating transactions and opening blocks. When the blockchain transitioned to proof-of-stake in September 2022, Ether inherited an additional duty as the blockchain's staking mechanism. The XRP Ledger's native cryptocurrency, XRP, is designed for financial institutions to facilitate transfers between different geographies. Because so many cryptocurrencies are on the market, it's important to understand the different types. Knowing whether the coin you're looking at has a purpose can help you decide whether it is worth investing in\u2014a cryptocurrency with a purpose is likely to be less risky than one that doesn't have a use. Most of the time, when you hear about cryptocurrency types, you hear the coin's name. However, coin names differ from coin types. Here are some of the types you'll find, with some of the names of tokens in that category: Utility: XRP and ETH are two examples of utility tokens. They serve specific functions on their respective blockchains. Transactional: Tokens designed to be used as a payment method. Bitcoin is the most well-known of these. Governance: These tokens represent voting or other rights on a blockchain, such as Uniswap. Platform: These tokens support decentralized applications, also known as dApps, which are built on a blockchain, such as Solana. Security tokens (asset-backed tokens): Tokens representing ownership of an asset, such as a stock that has been tokenized (value transferred to the blockchain). MS Token is an example of a securitized token. If you can find one of these for sale, you can gain partial ownership of the Millennium Sapphire. If you find a cryptocurrency that doesn't fall into one of these categories, you've likely discovered a new category or something that needs further investigation to ensure its legitimacy. How to Buy Cryptocurrency If you want to use cryptocurrency to buy products and services, you will need to visit a cryptocurrency exchange. These are businesses that allow you to buy or sell cryptocurrencies from other users at the current market price, similar to a stock. After buying the coins, you will need to transfer them to a crypto wallet or use a third-party service like Coinbase to store your coins. If you only want to buy cryptocurrency as an investment, you may be able to do so through your online brokerage. For example, Robinhood, which we found to be the best broker for cryptocurrency trading, allows users to invest in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. In addition, several crypto ETFs, such as Spot Bitcoin and Ethereum ETFs, provide exposure to the crypto asset class without requiring investors to maintain their wallets. For instance, investors may choose to hold Bitcoin ETF shares. The SEC has also approved the listing and trading of Ether spot shares. Is Cryptocurrency Legal? Fiat currencies derive their authority from the government or monetary authorities. For example, the U.S. dollar is recognized and issued by the government as the official currency of the United States and is \"legal tender.\" However, cryptocurrencies are not issued by any government entity. Therefore, it has been difficult to make a case for their legal status in different financial jurisdictions throughout the world. It doesn't help matters that cryptocurrencies have primarily functioned outside most existing financial infrastructure. Best practices for those interested in cryptocurrency are to check the national and local laws of your country of residence. While it may be legal in one jurisdiction, it may not be legal in another. In the US The legal status of cryptocurrencies creates implications for their use in daily transactions and trading. In June 2019, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommended that wire transfers of cryptocurrencies should be subject to the requirements of its Travel Rule, which requires AML compliance. Important Although cryptocurrencies are considered a form of money, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats them as financial assets or property for tax purposes. And, as with most other investments, if you reap capital gains from selling or trading cryptocurrencies, the government wants a piece of the profits. How exactly the IRS taxes digital assets\u2014either as capital gains or ordinary income\u2014depends on how long the taxpayer held the cryptocurrency and how they used it. In the United States in July 2023, courts ruled that cryptocurrencies are considered securities when purchased by institutional buyers but not by retail investors who purchase on exchanges. Enthusiasts called it a victory for crypto; however, crypto exchanges are regulated by the SEC, as are coin offerings or sales to institutional investors. So, crypto is legal in the U.S., but regulatory agencies are slowly gaining ground in the industry. As of August 2025, regulators are developing rules for cryptocurrency distribution, trading, and custody that will contribute to an eventual framework. In Asia Japan's Payment Services Act defines Bitcoin as legal property. Cryptocurrency exchanges operating in the country are required to collect information about their customers and details related to wire transfers. China has banned cryptocurrency exchanges, transactions, and mining within its borders, but has a Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC). However, this does not mean that mining does not occur in the country. India is reported to be formulating a framework for cryptocurrencies, but until it is enacted, crypto is not yet illegal. Exchanges are free to offer cryptocurrencies. In Europe Cryptocurrencies are legal in the European Union. Derivatives and other products that use cryptocurrencies must qualify as \"financial instruments.\" In June 2023, the European Commission's Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation went into effect. This law sets safeguards and establishes rules for companies or vendors providing financial services using cryptocurrencies. Is Cryptocurrency a Safe Investment? Cryptocurrencies have attracted a reputation as unstable investments due to high investor losses from scams, hacks, bugs, and volatility. Although the underlying cryptography and blockchain are generally secure, the technical complexity of using and storing crypto assets can be a significant hazard to new users. In addition to the market risks associated with speculative assets, cryptocurrency investors should be aware of the following risks: User risk: Unlike traditional finance, there is no way to reverse or cancel a cryptocurrency transaction after it has already been sent. According to Ledger, a well-known crypto wallet, analysts estimate that about 11 % to 18% of bitcoins are lost for various reasons.Regulatory risks: The regulatory status of some cryptocurrencies is still unclear in many areas, with some governments seeking to regulate them as securities, currencies, or both. A sudden regulatory crackdown could make it challenging to sell cryptocurrencies or cause a market-wide price drop.Counterparty risks: Many investors and merchants rely on exchanges or other custodians to store their cryptocurrency. Theft or loss by one of these third parties could result in losing one's entire investment.Management risks: Due to the lack of coherent regulations, there are few protections against deceptive or unethical management practices. Many investors have lost large sums to management teams that failed to deliver a product.Programming risks: Many investment and lending platforms use automated smart contracts to control the movement of user deposits. An investor using one of these platforms assumes the risk that a bug or exploit in these programs could cause them to lose their investment.Market Manipulation: Market manipulation remains a substantial problem for cryptocurrency investors, with influential people, organizations, and exchanges promoting their favored tokens. Despite these risks, cryptocurrencies have experienced a significant price surge, with the total market capitalization rising to approximately $2.98 trillion (As of December 15, 2025). Despite the asset's speculative nature, some have created substantial fortunes by taking on the risk of investing in early-stage cryptocurrencies. Advantages and Disadvantages of Cryptocurrency Cryptocurrencies were introduced with the intent to revolutionize financial infrastructure. As with every revolution, however, there are tradeoffs involved. At the current stage of development for cryptocurrencies, there are many differences between the theoretical ideal of a decentralized system with cryptocurrencies and its practical implementation. Advantages Removes single points of failure Easier to transfer funds between parties Removes third parties Can be used to generate returns Remittances are streamlined Disadvantages Transactions are pseudonymous Pseudonymity allows for criminal uses Have become highly centralized Expensive to participate in some networks and earn Off-chain security issues Prices are very volatile Advantages Explained Cryptocurrencies represent a new, decentralized paradigm for money. In this system, centralized intermediaries, such as banks and monetary institutions, are not necessary to enforce trust and police transactions between two parties. Thus, a system with cryptocurrencies eliminates the possibility of a single point of failure\u2014such as a large financial institution setting off a cascade of global crises, such as the one triggered in 2008 by the failure of large investment banks in the U.S. Cryptocurrencies promise to make transferring funds directly between two parties easier without needing a trusted third party like a bank or a credit card company. Such decentralized transfers are secured by the use of public keys and private keys and different forms of incentive systems, such as proof of work or proof of stake. Because they do not use third-party intermediaries, cryptocurrency transfers between two transacting parties can be faster than standard money transfers. Flash loans in decentralized finance are an excellent example of such decentralized transfers. These loans, which are processed without requiring collateral, can be executed within seconds and are mostly used in trading. The remittance economy is testing one of cryptocurrency's most prominent use cases. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin serve as intermediate currencies to streamline money transfers across borders. Thus, a fiat currency is converted into Bitcoin (or another cryptocurrency), transferred across borders, and subsequently converted back into the destination fiat currency without third-party involvement. Disadvantages Explained Though many claim crypto to be an anonymous form of transaction, cryptocurrencies are pseudonymous. They leave a digital trail that agencies like the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) can follow. This opens up the possibility for governments, authorities, and others to track financial transactions. Cryptocurrencies have become a popular tool for criminals to engage in nefarious activities, including money laundering and illicit purchases. The case of Dread Pirate Roberts, who ran a marketplace to sell drugs on the dark web, is already well known. Cryptocurrencies have also become a favorite of hackers who use them for ransomware activities. In theory, cryptocurrencies are designed to be decentralized, with their wealth distributed among many parties on a blockchain. Ownership is becoming more concentrated, as witnessed by companies such as Strategy purchasing and holding them for price appreciation and investment fund managers buying them to hold in the funds they manage. One of the conceits of cryptocurrencies is that anyone can mine them using a computer with an Internet connection. However, mining popular cryptocurrencies requires considerable energy, sometimes with daily energy use for mining only exceeding that of a household. The high energy costs and the unpredictability of mining have concentrated mining among large firms seeking to profit from the activity. Though cryptocurrency blockchains are highly secure, off-chain crypto-related key storage repositories, such as exchanges and wallets, can be hacked. Many cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets have been hacked over the years, sometimes resulting in the theft of millions of dollars in coins. Cryptocurrencies traded in public markets suffer from price volatility, so investments require accurate price monitoring. For example, Bitcoin has experienced rapid surges and crashes in its value, climbing to nearly $65,000 in November 2021 before dropping to just over $20,000 a year and a half later. Bitcoin prices had roared back by mid-2024 and reached a high of more than $124,000 by October 2025. As a result of this vast range of volatility, many people consider cryptocurrencies a speculative bubble. Is Crypto a Good Investment? Crypto can be a good investment for someone who enjoys speculating and can financially tolerate losing everything invested. However, it is not a wise investment for someone seeking to grow their retirement portfolio or for placing savings into it for growth. Which Crypto Is Best to Invest In? It depends on your financial circumstances, market outlook, risk tolerance, and goals. Crypto investing is generally best suited for speculators or those who can afford to incur losses. Including cryptocurrency as part of a portfolio is something that should be discussed with a financial advisor familiar with crypto. How Does Crypto Make You Money? There are several ways cryptocurrency can make money for you. Decentralized finance applications let you loan your crypto with interest; you can stake a compatible one on a blockchain or at certain exchanges for rewards, or you can hold on to it and hope its market value increases. None of these methods is guaranteed to make money, but many people have benefited from them. The Bottom Line Cryptocurrencies are digital assets that are secured by cryptography. As a relatively new technology, they are highly speculative, and it is important to understand the risks involved before investing.

      "title": "Investing in Crypto: Diversifying Your Portfolio",
      "content": "Cryptocurrency has captured the imagination of investors worldwide, driven by its potential for outsized returns and similarly outsized volatility. With a market capitalization that has soared to $4 trillion, it has gained traction within the corridors of Washington and become widely available to investors with the advent of crypto exchange-traded products (ETPs).\nSo, how should you think about cryptocurrency?\nIn a new report, Morgan Stanley\u2019s Global Investment Committee looks at the potential role of crypto in a diversified portfolio and how to consider sizing a position responsibly. A key takeaway for many investors: Proceed with caution. Unlike other asset classes, cryptocurrency has a limited track record, marked by strong returns but also exceptionally high volatility.\nHere\u2019s more on why a measured approach may be warranted.\nUnderstanding Crypto\u2019s Role in a Portfolio\nViews on cryptocurrency\u2019s potential role in a portfolio vary.\nSome investors see bitcoin\u2014currently the largest cryptocurrency by market cap\u2014as a type of \u201cdigital gold,\u201d due to its scarcity and potential as a hedge against inflation. Others compare Ethereum, the second-largest, to a fast-moving tech stock because of its potential to disrupt industries through innovations such as decentralized apps. Still others see crypto as a diversifying investment, helping reduce portfolio risk by not moving in tandem with other investments\u2014although there is evidence that crypto\u2019s correlations with risky assets like stocks have risen over time.\nThe Global Investment Committee categorizes crypto as a \u201creal asset,\u201d alongside commodities. Like gold, for instance, its value is often driven by broad economic factors, such as inflation expectations or monetary policy shifts, as well as technical market dynamics like changes in supply and demand, but not the financial health of an underlying business, as with stocks and bonds. Also like some commodities, crypto does not directly generate income through dividends or interest.\nRisks and Rewards\nThe Global Investment Committee expects cryptocurrency to deliver strong compound returns of around 6% over a seven-year horizon, but with significant risk to investors: Crypto\u2019s annualized volatility is about 55%\u2014which is approximately four times that of the S&P 500 Index.\nThis volatility means that crypto can experience dramatic price swings, including potential drawdowns of up to 70% over a 12-month period. A deeper dive shows that since 2010, the Bloomberg Bitcoin Galaxy Index has experienced a maximum drawdown of at least:\n- 10% in each rolling six-month period,\n- 30% in half of such periods and,\n- 50% in 30% of such periods.\nIn addition, because major cryptocurrencies increasingly tend to move in tandem with other risky assets, they do not always provide the diversification investors might seek.\nCrypto\u2019s limited history also means that investors may be \u201cdriving blind\u201d when trying to forecast future performance for any market conditions that differ from the past five to seven years. For example, while bitcoin has tended to generate higher returns amid more favorable financial conditions, it\u2019s unclear how it might fare in an environment of persistently higher interest rates, tighter financial conditions or lower liquidity.\nPortfolio Implications\nEven small allocations to crypto can have an outsized impact on overall portfolio risk. For example, adding just a 6% position in crypto to a growth-oriented portfolio nearly doubled overall volatility in our simulations. In some scenarios, the position swelled far beyond its target allocation due to rapid price increases, leaving the portfolio more susceptible to losses in the event of steep declines in the crypto allocation.\nThis underscores the need for disciplined portfolio rebalancing to periodically return a crypto allocation back to its target size.\nWith that in mind, we recommend limiting crypto allocations to:\n- Up to 4% in aggressive, \u201copportunistic growth\u201d portfolios, which generally seek higher returns from short-term market opportunities.\n- 3% in \u201cmarket growth\u201d portfolios, which often appeal to investors with a moderate-to-aggressive risk tolerance.\n- 2% for \u201cbalanced growth\u201d portfolios, which seek a mix of capital appreciation and income.\n- Zero exposure for more conservative investors focused on income or wealth preservation.\nAlso, consider funding any crypto position from risky assets, not cash, and using ETPs, where possible. The key is balance, grounded in thoughtful position sizing, regular rebalancing and a clear understanding of the risks.\nFor the most current insights and guidance, consult with your Morgan Stanley Financial Advisor and request a copy of the Global Investment Committee special report, Asset Allocation Considerations for Cryptocurrency.",

      "content": "At United Community Bank, our goal is to empower you with knowledge to help you navigate the complex world of finance, and this includes understanding cryptocurrency. We recognize its growing popularity and the curiosity it sparks, and this article outlines key considerations involved to provide clarity.\nPlease Note: We are not recommending buying or using cryptocurrency, nor endorsing any of the vendors or companies referenced as examples. Any decision to proceed should only be made after thorough personal research and consideration of the risks involved.\nCryptocurrency: A Digital Revolution with Risks and Opportunities\nCryptocurrency has emerged as a revolutionary financial innovation, offering an alternative to traditional government-issued currency. While digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and others have gained mainstream attention, they come with both risks and advantages that investors and users should carefully consider.\nWhat is Cryptocurrency?\nCryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that uses cryptography for security and operates on a decentralized system called the blockchain. Unlike traditional money, which is issued and regulated by governments, cryptocurrencies are maintained through distributed networks of computers. The most well-known cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, was introduced in 2009 as a peer-to-peer payment system independent of banks and financial institutions. Since then, thousands of cryptocurrencies have been developed, each with unique features and use cases.\nTransactions involving cryptocurrency are recorded on a public ledger, making them transparent and difficult to alter. This decentralized approach reduces the need for intermediaries allowing for faster and potentially cheaper transactions. However, this same feature also brings challenges that make cryptocurrency a risky investment and financial tool.\nKey Risks of Cryptocurrency\n1. Market Volatility\nCryptocurrency prices are notoriously unstable, often experiencing dramatic fluctuations within hours. For example, Bitcoin\u2019s price has seen extreme highs and lows, with gains of thousands of dollars followed by sharp declines. Unlike traditional assets, cryptocurrencies are largely driven by speculation, media hype, and investor sentiment, making them highly unpredictable.\n2. Regulatory Uncertainty\nGovernments and financial regulators worldwide are still developing policies on how to manage cryptocurrencies. Some countries have embraced digital currencies, while others have imposed restrictions or outright bans. Sudden regulatory changes can impact the value of cryptocurrencies or even limit their use in certain regions. Investors must stay informed about evolving regulations that could affect their holdings.\n3. Security and Fraud Risks\nDespite blockchain\u2019s secure nature, cryptocurrency exchanges and wallets remain prime targets for hackers. Billions of dollars in digital assets have been stolen through cyberattacks, phishing scams, and fraud. Since transactions are often irreversible, victims of theft or fraud have little recourse for recovering lost funds. Unlike traditional banks, which offer protections like FDIC insurance, cryptocurrency users are responsible for securing their own assets.\n4. Tax Considerations\nCryptocurrency taxation is complex and varies by country. In many places, including in the United States, cryptocurrencies are classified as digital assets and treated as property rather than currency, which means transactions may trigger capital gain taxes. However, tax laws are still evolving, and some investors and users may unknowingly fail to report taxable events, leading to potential penalties.\n5. Lack of Consumer Protection\nTraditional financial systems provide safeguards for consumers, such as fraud protection and dispute resolution. With cryptocurrency, once a transaction is completed, it cannot be reversed. If a user sends funds to the wrong address or falls victim to a scam, there is no central authority to intervene. This lack of oversight makes cryptocurrency attractive to criminals engaging in illicit activities, adding to concerns about its widespread adoption.\n6. Environmental Concerns\nSome cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, require significant computing power to maintain their networks. Mining operations, which validate transactions and create new coins, consume vast amounts of energy. Critics argue that this contributes to environmental damage, prompting calls for more energy-efficient blockchain technologies.\nWhile it\u2019s important to highlight the risks, cryptocurrency also offers several key benefits that have contributed to its growing popularity.\nKey Benefits of Cryptocurrency\n1. Decentralization\nOne of the biggest advantages of cryptocurrency is decentralization. Unlike traditional currencies that are controlled by governments and central banks, cryptocurrencies operate on decentralized networks, giving individuals greater control over their financial transactions. This is especially beneficial in countries with unstable economies or restrictive banking systems.\n2. Lower Transaction Costs and Faster Transfers\nCryptocurrency transactions, particularly for international transfers, can be faster and cheaper than traditional payment transactions methods. Payment processors often charge high fees and take several days to process transactions, whereas cryptocurrencies can facilitate near-instant payments with lower costs.\n3. Increased Security and Transparency\nBlockchain technology, which underpins cryptocurrencies, offers a high level of security and transparency. Transactions are recorded on a public ledger, making fraud and unauthorized changes extremely difficult. This can reduce the risk of corruption and financial manipulation.\n4. Potential for High Returns\nMany early investors in cryptocurrencies have seen significant returns, as digital assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum have dramatically increased in value over the years. While this comes with high volatility, some investors view cryptocurrency as a new asset class with long-term growth potential.\n5. Accessibility and Inclusion\nCryptocurrency provides financial services to people who may not have access to traditional banking. With just an internet connection, individuals can send, receive, and store digital assets, opening financial opportunities for unbanked populations around the world.\nConclusion\nCryptocurrency represents a transformative shift in the financial world, offering both opportunities and challenges. While digital currencies provide decentralization, transparency, and financial inclusion, they also pose risks such as volatility, security threats, and regulatory uncertainty. Investors and users should approach cryptocurrency with caution, conduct thorough research, and take necessary precautions to protect their assets.",

      "title": "What to Know About Cryptocurrency and Cybersecurity Risks",
      "content": "-\nPersonal Banking -\nInsights\nWhat to Know About Cryptocurrency and Cybersecurity Risks\nCryptocurrency, Bitcoin, Litecoin, blockchain \u2014 you don't need a passion for technology or fintech to be familiar with these terms. But until just a few years ago, the notion that a digital currency would so rapidly become a mainstream news topic - let alone be a popular investment option - seemed outlandish. Now, consumers are wondering if this nebulous asset just might be worth adding to their portfolios.\nThe Top Cyber Risks of the Cryptocurrency Industry\nWith cryptocurrency attracting a lot of media coverage, it can be easy to get swept up in the mystery and excitement associated with this innovative, if vastly misunderstood, asset. The risks, however, are real. And they can be financially devastating for those who don't recognize them and know how to shield themselves from the dangers associated with digital currency. The following are a few of the main cybersecurity risks to consider if you're dealing with cryptocurrencies.\nYour Cryptocurrency Account Security\nTo appreciate the risks of buying cryptocurrencies, it's essential to understand that any digital currency is accessed via a private \"key,\" which is a complex password code that grants users access to a digital account.\n\u201cWhen it comes to risks with cryptocurrency, I think the main one is that most people store their private key on their PC like any other file,\" said Bryan Gour, cyber innovation architect at City National Bank. \u201cThere are a lot of dangers associated with keeping a key on a computer. It's highly risky because it's so easy for hackers to access a person's computer. And once a key is stolen, there's no getting it back. It's like having a credit card with no authentication check. That money is gone for good.\"\nScott Sadler, chief executive officer of Keystone Blockchain Investments is a cryptocurrency investment manager, trader and policy expert. He also warned of the dangers of an account breach. \u201cCryptocurrency investments should be allocated to the \u201chigh risk\" portion of your portfolio. You're the only responsible party for ownership and security of the crypto asset and any mistakes are immutable. If you lose your key, you can lose the investment permanently.\"\nUnregulated and Hackable Cryptocurrency Exchanges\nWhat makes investing in digital currency so thrilling is also what makes it risky. Because digital currency is decentralized, there is no body or administrator overseeing the creation, movement and management of the currency. Cryptocurrency exchanges, where digital money is bought and traded, are regulated inconsistently \u2014 if at all \u2014depending on which country they are in. They have nowhere near the same level of governmental oversight or auditability as traditional banks.\nThere is also the issue of security. During the past several years, numerous exchanges have made headlines because of massive security breaches, including Coincheck, which had more than $550 million worth of crypto stolen by hackers, or Bithub, which lost about $30 million.\n\u201cThe world of cryptocurrency is the Wild West,\" explained John Gomez, chief executive officer of Sensato Cybersecurity Solutions. \u201cThe amount of attacks being propagated against crypto exchanges and systems is mind-boggling. We have seen attacks by North Korea, terrorist groups and nation states, who can use the fruits of the attack to fund their operations. Unfortunately, there is no governing body so there is no requirement for security audits, assessments or controls when it comes to these systems.\"\nConfusion About Blockchain and Cryptoexchanges\nThe blockchain technology and even the very nature of cryptocurrency itself is extremely complex and difficult to understand. Usually, companies create something that investors can see, feel or use. But digital currency is essentially a non-entity \u2014 something that exists only in the ether of the internet. Even the creator of Bitcoin, the first and most popular cryptocurrency, is a mysterious individual known only under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto.\nThe unknown factors surrounding digital assets far outweigh concrete facts, and that make them a very volatile investment. Because of the unknowns, it becomes nearly impossible for even the most careful investors to do proper due diligence.\nIs Cryptocurrency Worth the Risk?\nWith the potential cybersecurity risks of cryptocurrency, as well as the volatility of the currency, many advisors and financial institutions, including City National Bank, advocate against participating in the cryptocurrency market at this point.\n\"Transaction errors cannot be corrected,\" Sadler said. \"You are responsible for ensuring that any transactions you initiate have the correct amount and destination. Mistakes can't be changed or rectified.\"\nFor investors who are seeking the thrill of a high-risk asset in their portfolio, there are other options available.\nHow To Better Protect Your Cryptocurrency Account from Hackers\nDespite the cybersecurity risk, many still want to participate in the cryptocurrency market - whether in hopes of becoming an overnight millionaire or simply to be part of a new wave of technology. If you're one of those people, these tips may help secure your cryptocurrency account.\nMake Security a Top Priority\nAn individual's private key is the only way to access this kind of investment, therefore it's vital to keep it safe. \u201cOne of the best things to do to protect yourself is not to keep your key online where it can be hacked,\" said Gour. \"People should use something called a hardware wallet \u2014 an item that looks like a USB and contains their private code \u2014 like a Ledger or a Trezor.\"\nUsing such a device means your key is encoded onto a hardware wallet and when you want to do a transaction, you plug the wallet into your computer, but the code never leaves the hardware device, so it's much less likely to be accessed or stolen from your computer. You can also make duplicates of the wallet and put one in a safe deposit box, so you never lose your key.\nArm Yourself with Knowledge\nThere's a technical level of discomfort almost always associated with fully understanding what a private key does and how the cryptocurrency system works.\n\"People must realize you can't just sit at your computer and click buttons like with an e-trade account,\" said Gour. \"Cryptocurrency requires a much higher level of engagement.\" He encourages those who are considering investing in cryptocurrency to read and learn as much as they can about the subject. The more you know about it and become familiar with it, the more you can better secure yourself against the risks of digital currency.\nAnother way to gain knowledge is through experience. Monitoring and trading in digital assets takes much more time, patience and caution than traditional investments, noted Sadler.\nFor this reason, Sadler advises clients to start small. \"I tell my clients to open an account, get a wallet and buy a tiny amount,\" he said. \"Buy $10 and then see what you're dealing with, because if you lose it, it doesn't matter.\"\nStarting with a small investment will allow you to learn more about the process and understand how the platforms work. \"Then, if you want to make a meaningful investment, you must decide whether you want to invest not only in cryptocurrencies, but also invest in the time it takes to learn about them, so you can be self-reliant,\" Sadler said. \"If not, then evaluate your options to engage a third party to manage your investment for you.\"\nConsult with Your Investment Advisor\nIf you've purchased cryptocurrency on your own or you're planning on it, cue in your investment advisors. Although they may not recommend purchasing cryptocurrency, they may be able to connect you with third-party resources to better educate and assist you if you choose to do so.\nUndoubtedly, purchasing cryptocurrency is both fascinating and fraught with risk. Knowing what the dangers are and how to protect digital assets will help you make an informed decision to determine if investing in digital currency is the right choice for you.\nThis article is for general information and education only.
