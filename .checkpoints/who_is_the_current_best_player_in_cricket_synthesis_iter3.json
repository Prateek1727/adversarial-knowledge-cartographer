      "content": "ICC Men's Player Rankings\nThe International Cricket Council player rankings is a widely followed system of rankings for international cricketers based on their recent performances.\nThe ratings were developed at the suggestion of Ted Dexter in 1987.[1] The intention was to produce a better indication of players' current standing in the sport than is provided by comparing their averages. Career averages are based on a player's entire career and do not make any allowance for match conditions or the strength of the opposition, whereas the ratings are weighted towards recent form and account for match conditions and the quality of the opponent using statistical algorithms.[2]\nInitially the rankings were for Test cricket only, but separate One Day International rankings were introduced in 1998. Both sets of rankings have now been calculated back to the start of those forms of the game. The rankings include the top 10 Test, ODI and T20I batsmen, bowlers and all-rounders based on the rating of each player.\nRankings calculations\n[edit]The player rankings are a weighted average of all a player's performances, with recent matches weighted most heavily (so the overall effect of a good or bad performance decline over time). Each match performance is given a rating out of 1000, based on a set of pre-determined criteria, and these figures averaged.[3] This means that the maximum possible overall rating is 1000, and a player gaining a rating of 900 is seen as an exceptional achievement.[4] Separate lists are maintained for batting and bowling and an all-rounder rating is also published, which is obtained by multiplying a player's batting and bowling rating together and dividing by 1000.\nFor batting, the performance rating is based on a combination of runs scored, the rating of the opposition bowlers, match result and comparison to the overall scores in the match. A bowler gains points based on wickets taken, runs conceded and match result, with more points gained for dismissing highly rated batsmen. A damping-factor is applied to a player's rating at the start of their career, so they do not get a full rating for their performances until they have played about 20 Tests.\nTest rankings\n[edit]Top 10 Test batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 Test bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 Test all-rounders\n[edit]ODI rankings\n[edit]Top 10 ODI batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 ODI bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 ODI all-rounders\n[edit]T20I rankings\n[edit]Top 10 T20I batsmen\n[edit]Top 10 T20I bowlers\n[edit]Top 10 T20I all-rounders\n[edit]Historical rankings\n[edit]Historical Test cricket rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in Test cricket\n[edit]Batting and Bowling and All-rounders with a peak rating of 900 points or more\n[edit]- All-rounders with a peak rating of 500 points or more[7]\nHistorical One Day International (ODI) cricket rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in ODI cricket\n[edit]Top 10 rankings: batting and bowling with a peak rating of 850 points or more\n[edit]- Top 10 Rankings All-rounder[10]\nHistorical T20I rankings\n[edit]Year end top ranked players in T20I cricket\n[edit]Top 10 T20I rankings: batting and bowling with a peak rating of 750 points or more\n[edit]- Top 10 Rankings Batting[11]\n- Top 10 Rankings Bowling[12]\n- Top 10 Rankings All-rounder[13]\nSee also\n[edit]- ICC Men's Test Team Rankings\n- ICC Men's ODI Team Rankings\n- ICC Men's T20I Team Rankings\n- International cricket\n- ICC Women's Player Rankings\nReferences\n[edit]- ^ Eastaway, Rob. \"How the World Cricket Rankings were born\".\n- ^ \"About ICC Cricket Rankings\".

This suggests that the research landscape for \"who is the current best player in cricket\" is complex and multifaceted, with various perspectives and opinions.\n\n**The Battleground:**\n\nOur research identified five battleground topics where sources disagreed on specific points. These topics are:\n\n1. **Who is the current best batsman across 3 formats?**\n   Conflicting Claims:\n   - Side A: Virat Kohli (credibility: 0.54)\n   - Side B: Ben Duckett (credibility: 0.54)\n   Disagreement Reason: Conflicting interpretations or perspectives\n   Verdict: Insufficient evidence to determine which side is correct (confidence: 0.50)\n\n   The disagreement on this topic may be due to different methodologies or datasets used to evaluate the players' performance across three formats. Some sources may prioritize international matches, while others may consider domestic tournaments or franchise leagues.\n\n2. **Best Cricket Player in 2025**\n   Conflicting Claims:\n   - Side A: Virat Kohli is the best cricket player in 2025. (credibility: 0.54)\n   - Side B: Babar Azam is the best cricket player in 2025. (credibility: 0.54)\n   Disagreement Reason: Conflicting interpretations or perspectives\n   Verdict: Insufficient evidence to determine which side is correct (confidence: 0.50)\n\n   The disagreement on this topic may be due to different criteria used to evaluate the players' performance in 2025. Some sources may prioritize batting averages, while others may consider the number of centuries scored or the impact on the team's overall performance.\n\n3. **Best Batsman across 3 formats**\n   Conflicting Claims:\n   - Side A: Ben Duckett is the best batsman across 3 formats. (credibility: 0.54)\n   - Side B: Head is the best batsman across 3 formats. (credibility: 0.54)\n   Disagreement Reason: Conflicting interpretations or perspectives\n   Verdict: Insufficient evidence to determine which side is correct (confidence: 0.50)\n\n   The disagreement on this topic may be due to different datasets or methodologies used to evaluate the players' performance across three formats. Some sources may prioritize international matches, while others may consider domestic tournaments or franchise leagues.\n\n4. **Best Cricket Player in 2025**\n   Conflicting Claims:\n   - Side A: Virat Kohli is the best cricket player in 2025. (credibility: 0.54)\n   - Side B: Babar Azam is the best cricket player in 2025. (credibility: 0.54)\n   Disagreement Reason: Conflicting interpretations or perspectives\n   Verdict: Insufficient evidence to determine which side is correct (confidence: 0.50)\n\n   This topic is identical to the second battleground topic, suggesting that the disagreement is not due to a lack of evidence but rather conflicting interpretations or perspectives.\n\n5. **Best Batsman across 3 formats**\n   Conflicting Claims:\n   - Side A: Ben Duckett is the best batsman across 3 formats. (credibility: 0.54)\n   - Side B: Head is the best batsman across 3 formats. (credibility: 0.54)\n   Disagreement Reason: Conflicting interpretations or perspectives\n   Verdict: Insufficient evidence to determine which side is correct (confidence: 0.50)\n\n   This topic is identical to the third battleground topic, suggesting that the disagreement is not due to a lack of evidence but rather conflicting interpretations or perspectives.\n\n**The Verdict:**\n\nBased on source credibility (domain authority, citation count), we cannot definitively determine which side is more likely correct for each battleground topic. However, we can provide some insights based on the relationships and entities identified in our research.\n\n* **Virat Kohli** is consistently ranked as one of the top players in the ICC Player Rankings, with a credibility score of 0.54. He has also been ranked as the best batsman across three formats, with a credibility score of 0.54.\n* **Babar Azam** is also consistently ranked as one of the top players in the ICC Player Rankings, with a credibility score of 0.54. He has also been ranked as the best cricket player in 2025, with a credibility score of 0.54.\n* **Ben Stokes** is a highly skilled all-rounder who has been ranked as one of the top players in the ICC Player Rankings, with a credibility score of 0.54.\n* **Shubman Gill** is a talented young batsman who has been ranked as one of the top players in the ICC Player Rankings, with a credibility score of 0.54.\n\nIn conclusion, our research suggests that the current best player in cricket is a matter of ongoing debate and discussion. While some sources may prioritize Virat Kohli or Babar Azam, others may consider Ben Stokes or Shubman Gill. Ultimately, the answer to this question will depend on individual perspectives and interpretations of the data.\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Graph (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    \"Virat
