      "content": "Can you still buy the Google Pixel 9? Here's how much you'll have to pay\nForget Pixel 10, the Pixel 9 is still available if you really want it\nThe Google Pixel 10 may have just been unveiled, ahead of its August 28 launch, but is it the only option for potential Pixel hopefuls? After all, the Google Pixel 9 is only a year old, and typically older models enjoy some generous discounts once they hit that milestone.\nThen again some phones simply disappear from store shelves, as focus is shifted to the new model. So which fate has befallen the Google Pixel 9? Can you still buy last year's Google phone, and how much is it going to cost you compared to the Pixel 10?\nThe good news is that the Pixel 9 is still available to purchase, as are the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. The bad news is that the prices haven't actually changed \u2014 they essentially cost the same as their Pixel 10 counterparts.\nPixel 9 at Google Store\nIf anyone was going to discount the Pixel 9 series, you'd think Google would be it. But checking the Google Store and there don't seem to be any discounts on Pixel 9 series devices as of this writing. That means the Pixel 9 is going to set you back at least $799, which is the exact same price as the Pixel 10.\nAdmittedly, the Pixel 9 is available right away and there seems to be plenty of stock available in all colors and storage options. The Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL aren't quite as readily available, but as long as you're not picky about the color you get then all the different storage options are available.\nit may not be enjoying any discounts right now, but the Pixel 9 is still available to purchase at the Google Store. It's a tried-and-tested Google phone with a year's worth of updates and fixes under its belt already. This is far from the lowest price we've seen this phone go, and the more advanced Pixel 10 models go on sale August 28.\nAlso available: Pixel 9 Pro ($999) | Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1,099)\nThe Pixel 9 Pro still costs $999, the same as the Pixel 10 Pro, though the Pixel 9 Pro XL is $100 cheaper than its successor at $1,099. That lower price is due to the fact Google still sells the 9 Pro XL with 128GB of storage, which isn't the case for the Pixel 10 Pro XL and its 256GB base storage.\nPixel 9 at Amazon\nBeing the retail behemoth that it is, Amazon has a lot of different Pixel 9 options from a variety of sellers in various levels of condition \u2014 and it's not always obvious from the search menu whether you're looking at a new or refurbished model. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to focus on devices that are brand new and unlocked.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nAnyone hoping to pick up a Pixel 9 can get a $50 discount on the original $799 price tag \u2014 but only if they buy that phone in wintergreen. The black model has had no discount, and white is more expensive for some reason. Considering we've seen this phone drop as low as $499 in the past few weeks, I wouldn't recommend this deal at all.\nSave $180 on the cost of the Pixel 9 Pro XL over at Amazon. It's nowhere near the lowest price we've seen for this phone, it is still considerably cheaper than the Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 and it has all the best technology Google had to offer this time last year.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is a little bit better off, with a $909 price tag for the black model \u2014 the other options are apparently sold out. Again, though, that's not an amazing deal. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is much better value, with the black model dropping to $929, but that's still almost $150 more than the lowest ever price.\nGoogle Pixel 9 at Best Buy\nThe good news is that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are both available to purchase at Best Buy. The bad news is that they're both listed at full price, and you can only get the Pro in black. Pixel 9 buyers have a little more choice, since the wintergreen option is also available.\nFortunately the Pixel 9 Pro XL is both in stock and discounted to $989 \u2014 which actually makes it slightly cheaper than the smaller Pixel 9 Pro. But it's still a lot higher than this phone's all-time low.\nPixel 9 at Walmart\nWalmart is very much like Amazon, in that you're potentially buying from multiple sellers rather than Walmart itself. So there are a lot of used or refurbished Pixel 9 models listed for sale, which muddies things up slightly.\nSadly new and unlocked models appear to be out of stock across the entire Pixel 9 lineup. That means no Pixel 9, no Pixel 9 Pro and no Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nPixel 9 at AT&T\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is available at AT&T, though it appears the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are unavailable. The former is out of stock, while the latter is apparently just not visible on the carrier's website.\nHowever those of you hunting for the XL have some caveats to contend with. The first being that AT&T is only stocking the 256GB model, and it costs the same amount as the Pixel 10 Pro XL. To make the Pixel 9 Pro XL even less appealing, the 10 Pro XL has a pre-order bonus that nets you the handset for free with any eligible trade-in.\nThat same deal isn't on offer for the 9 Pro XL \u2014 meaning you'll have to pay the full $1,249 price out of pocket.\nPixel 9 at T-Mobile\nAll 3 non-folding Pixel 9 devices appear to be out of stock at T-Mobile, not that it would have mattered. The three phones are all listed with the same price tags as their Pixel 10 counterparts \u2014 which is full retail.\nPixel 9 at Verizon\nThe only Pixel 9 option available at Verizon is a 128GB Pixel 9 Pro for $999 \u2014 and like the Ford Model T, it's only available in black.\nBoth the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL are listed as out of stock, with no colors or storage options available to order.\nShould you buy the Pixel 9 right now?\nThe question you may have right now is whether it's actually worth buying a Pixel 9, or Pixel 9 Pro, right now. Honestly, I would recommend against it for the time being. While stock levels do seem to be declining, being patient is far more likely to pay off.\nPixel 9s have been on sale a lot over the past 12 months, and those discounts were pushed to their extreme in the run-up to the Pixel 10 launch event. The Pixel 9 dropped below the cost of a full-price Pixel 9a, and in comparison the full $799 retail price seems like a complete rip-off. The same goes for the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, which have dropped their prices by several hundred dollars in the recent past.\nMy gut would tell me that, faced with the prospect of paying the same price for a Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, you're better off picking the newer phone. But we are at that weird point between the Pixel 10 announcement and its actual release, which means we don't really have a complete picture of how the new phone will perform until we do a full review.\nPlus, odds are we'll see retailers slashing prices to try and clear stock once the Pixel 10 is actually released on August 28. At which point you can better decide whether you want to pay out for the latest model, or save some money with last year's (admittedly very good) tech.\nMore from Tom's Guide\n- Pixelsnap is the Pixel 10 upgrade everyone should be the most excited about \u2014 here's why\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro has a hidden display upgrade that could save you a headache\n- The Google Pixel 10 will let you share your location through satellite \u2014 here\u2019s what we know\nTom is the Tom's Guide's UK Phones Editor, tackling the latest smartphone news and vocally expressing his opinions about upcoming features or changes.

As it so happens, I have a killer deal for you.\nOver at Amazon, the 128GB Pixel 9 is on sale for $499, a nice 38% discount. This deal applies to every color option: Wintergreen, Obsidian (black), and Porcelain (white). If you want extra space, the 256GB Pixel 9 is also on sale for $599; however, it's only available in Porcelain.\nAlso: The 10+ best early Black Friday phone deals to grab now\nIt is possible to get either Pixel 9 model for free through Amazon's trade-in system, but the amount of money being shaved off depends on what you're trading in. For example, trading in an OnePlus 13 will only net you a $100 discount.\nAlthough the Pixel 10 series has been around for a few months now, the Pixel 9 remains one of the most compelling Android smartphones in 2025. Its main accomplishment is being a premium device without the cost, thanks to several factors.\nFirst off, the Pixel 9 has a solid design. The combination of the flat-sided aluminum frame, signature camera bar, and 6.3-inch Actua OLED touchscreen gives the smartphone a sleek, modern look. And it is compact enough to hold comfortably in one hand. Add in IP68 durability, and you get a mobile device that feels every bit as durable and polished as newer flagships.\nReview: Google Pixel 9\nPerformance is equally impressive. Powered by Google's Tensor G4 chip and 12GB of RAM, the Pixel 9 feels fast and responsive, whether you're multitasking, gaming, or utilizing the many AI tools, such as the Gemini assistant. Artificial intelligence isn't limited to chat bot, as it is also integrated into the camera system.\nAdd Me, for example, lets you add yourself to a group photo if you find yourself the photographer in a shot. It combines two images together so that everyone is together in a picture. Then there's Magic Editor. This feature makes complex edits easy to do. You could remove distracting objects in a shot or resize something with a few taps of the screen.\nI can't forget the camera system. Google's device has two cameras: a 50MP lens and a 48MP ultrawide option, allowing for crisp, highly detailed photographs. While the cameras on the Pro models are superior, the Pixel 9 still delivers results that rival those of flagship phones.\nHow I rated this deal\nAs per ZDNET's rating system, I give the deal a score of 4/5. 38% off is an awesome discount, especially for a smartphone that delivers a solid performance, houses smart AI tech, and has great cameras. I recommend the Pixel 9 to anyone looking for a new mobile device for themselves or for a loved one.\nThere is a chance that it could drop even lower during Black Friday. But considering that it's almost half off, I think this is as good as it's going to get. I would love to be wrong, though.\nWhen will this deal expire?\nDeals are subject to sell out or expire at any time, though ZDNET remains committed to finding, sharing, and updating the best product deals for you to score the best savings.

We've rounded up all of this week's best deals on these stunning devices and listed them out right here on this page. You'll find Pixel 9 deals for both the US and UK here as well as a range of carriers and today's best options for unlocked devices.\nPrices for the latest range of Pixel phones start at $799 / \u00a3799 for the standard device, $999 / \u00a3999 for the Pixel 9 Pro, and $1,099 / \u00a31,099 for the Pixel 9 Pro XL.

Our Google Pixel 9 review, Google Pixel 9 Pro review and Google Pixel 9 Pro XL review are all incredibly positive, praising the modern designs, the excellent Google Tensor G4 chipset, and big improvements to the battery, camera, and display.\nIf any of these handsets sound like the right one for you, check out all the best Google Pixel 9 deals below.\nToday's best Google Pixel 9 deals in the US\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL: free with a new unlimited data line at Verizon\nAll three Pixel 9 devices are currently free alongside a new unlimited data line at Verizon this week, so naturally I'm going to recommend you pick up the excellent 9 Pro XL. Unlike with previous promotions on this device at Verizon, right now no trade-ins are needed to get this device for free. Note that you may need a line on one of the pricier unlimited plans to be eligible for this promotion, though.\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nGoogle Pixel 9: was $799 now $399 with one year of unlimited data for free at Mint Mobile\nMint's been offering a hefty price cut on the Google Pixel 9 for a few months now but the prepaid carrier has just refreshed its promotion with another excellent freebie. Right now, you can get a full year of unlimited data for free, meaning you'll pay just $720 upfront for a device and two whole years of unlimited data. That averages out at just $15/mo - great value.\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nGoogle Pixel 9: free with a new plan at T-Mobile\nThere are quite a few options for a Pixel 9 device at T-Mobile this week but the carrier's deals on the standard Pixel 9 are my favorite. The device is currently being given away with new lines on multiple plan options currently, including some reasonably priced plans, without the need for a trade-in. Note, if you do want to trade, then you can instead get up to $1,000 off either the Pro or Pro XL this week.\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nGoogle Pixel 9: $10.99/mo with an unlimited plan, plus $200 off at AT&T\nThe Google Pixel 9 was going for as little as $6/mo at AT&T in recent weeks but the carrier has just reverted it back to $11/mo, which is a bummer. You don't, however, need to trade-in to get this particular deal so it's a pretty good option all around if you're not eligible for a trade. Note, if you'd prefer to go for the Pro or Pro XL, then you'll be able to get a massive discount of up to $1,000 off with a trade-in.\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nWith a full $300 off, today's deal on the Google Pixel 9 Pro at Amazon brings this stunning flagship phone down to a new record-low price. With an excellent four and a half stars out of five from our review, the Pixel 9 Pro is an easy recommendation from us. Not only do you get a superb, premium design and some of the best cameras you'll find on any smartphone, but seven years of guaranteed updates mean you'll get plenty of life out of the device.\nRead moreRead less\u25bc\nGoogle Pixel 9 series: up to $800 off with Google Fi\nGoogle is a good choice if you're looking for an unlocked device; mainly because it operates its own trade-in rebate system that you can use to get a superb discount of up to $660 off. If you're looking to pair up your device with a prepaid carrier, you could also consider the Google Store's deal on the Google Fi service, which lets you bundle up a device alongside a plan to get a massive rebate of up to $800 off over the duration of two years.\nToday's best Google Pixel 9 deals in the UK\nGoogle Pixel 9 deals: FAQ\nHow much does the Pixel 9 range cost?\nWhat's new with the Google Pixel 9?\n- New XL-sized Pro model\n- Tensor G4 chipset\n- Refreshed design\n- Display, camera, and battery improvements\nThe Google Pixel 9 range represents one of the biggest upgrades we've seen in recent years from the brand. Not only have all devices received a major design refresh and new chipset but there are also a few more models in the lineup.\nNew for this year are 'XL' and Fold Pro models, which replace the old Pixel 8 Pro as the most premium device in the range. The Fold, as you'd imagine, is a brand new foldable design, whereas the XL is a more like-for-like replacement of the Pixel 8 Pro with a larger display versus the standard model. The latest Pixel 9 Pro is essentially the same form factor as the standard Pixel 9 but carries all the features exclusive to the Pro line.\nAlongside the new Tensor G4 chipset, the Pixel 9 Pro models have an upgraded 16GB of RAM, a new 42MP front camera, and improved video features (super zoom and 8K). These improvements are available in both the 6.8-inch Pro XL and 6.3-inch Pro models so can you choose between a decently-sized phone and something a little more pocket-friendly.\nThe standard Google Pixel 9 comes in at 6.3 inches and includes the new Tensor G4 chipset, a new 48MP ultra-wide lens, and an upgraded display that's 35% brighter. It also features an improved battery that's bigger and supports faster charging. Overall, it's quite a significant upgrade - enough for the standard model to stand on its own as a serious flagship contender.\nAll Google Pixel 9 devices include a lengthy seven years of guaranteed updates as well as a focus on AI integration via Google's new Gemini assistant. Gemini can help you do everything from daily planning to translation with a new Pixel 9-exclusive feature called 'Pixel Screenshots' being a particular highlight.\nif you want to save more money, check out our Google Workspace promo codes page.\nSign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more.\nAlex is TechRadar's retail editor, specializing in deals, buying advice, and general tips on how to save our readers as much cash as possible.
