      "content": "What is a Topic-Based Test?\nIn this post, we will discuss the format of the CAEL Test, and focus on what a \u201ctopic-based\u201d test is, and how it provides you with an accurate representation of language use in a Canadian academic context.\nThe CAEL Test is structured to mirror the academic content of a first-year college or university course. When you take CAEL, you will read articles, listen to lectures, answer questions, and write a short essay, just as you would in your classroom. The unifying feature of CAEL, and what sets it apart from other academic language proficiency tests, is that it is topic-based.\nTopic-based means that during your test, you will use more than one skill to answer questions on a unified topic. For example, a speaking task will require you to answer questions based on what you have read and listened to, and to write responses based on a reading passage and mini-lecture. This approach assesses your ability to synthesize information from a variety of sources, just as you would be expected to in your post-secondary courses. When you are writing in a college or university course, you will be required to bring together information from a variety of sources such as lectures, online materials, books, and journals. By preparing for the test, and by practicing these skills, the CAEL Test will prepare you for these activities when you encounter them in college and university classrooms.\nTopic-Based Features:\n- During your test, you will use a variety of information sources to answer each set of questions for each task: speaking about what you\u2019ve listened to, writing about what you\u2019ve heard.\n- Topic-based testing represents the types of work you will encounter in university and college courses, helping you to prepare for post-secondary life\nConclusions:\n- For test takers that want to demonstrate their language proficiency, as well as prepare for their college and university courses, CAEL gives an accurate representation of both\n- CAEL tasks include each of the four primary language skills: listening, reading, writing, and speaking",

      "content": "he importance of assessment for online learning provision is enormous. How else would you know that a learner gets the materials, or your online course serves its goal?\nAnd there, you\u2019d know that assessments aren\u2019t just checkpoints. They guide the teacher and the learner toward a better understanding of the material, degree of acquired knowledge, and course effectiveness.\nBut what is the best way to assess somebody's knowledge? You could think of a test, a quiz, or even an exam. So, there is no definite answer, at least for now. Moreover, they aren\u2019t the same despite course creators use them interchangeably.\nDon\u2019t be puzzled! Join us in our quiz vs test vs exam comparison where we shed some light on the topic and tackle the confusion.\nQuiz vs test vs exam: Why are they so crucial?\nBefore we jump to the glossary and the differences between different types of learner\u2019s assessments, let\u2019s cover some basics.\nWhether you are in the middle of your quiz vs test comparison, exam vs test research, or deciding which one to use, you should start with why they are so crucial. For a start, they can affect the course provision, students\u2019 performance, and the course outcomes. Every test allows you to:\n- Align your learning expectations with the actual knowledge the students get.\n- Provide more structure and focus to the learning process.\n- Show the effectiveness of your learning method.\n- Indicate blind spots in the comprehension of materials and define areas for improvement.\nBefore crafting a quiz, ask yourself what function it will serve. It may be for the sake of understanding, structure, assessment method, or future improvement.\nWhen opting for quiz vs test application, these basic questions can help you define which type of assignment you may need:\n- Can a test after or before the lecture give you insights into the learning process?\n- Will a quiz hint to the learner an area, skill, or knowledge worth focusing on?\n- Will it help you determine what was missed?\n- Does it affect grade or motivation to proceed with the course?\nWhat is a quiz?\nNow, let\u2019s switch to the key differences between different types of assignments.\nIn particular, what are quizzes?\nA quiz is a short and quick assessment of the learner\u2019s knowledge, offering a test that consists of no more than 15 questions and takes no more than 5 minutes.\nThe main goal of the quizzes is to help students retain knowledge after the module, engage them after the lesson, and help cover the topic after a small amount of info.\n- When to apply? Quizzes are rather informal, so it is ideal for enforcing engagement in the classroom and supporting ideas presented in the lecture, lesson, or webinar.\n- Format of questions: fill-in-the-blank, true/false, pop-tests, multiple-questions.\nIn terms of quiz vs test comparison, the quiz has fewer questions, takes less time, and is less formal. Moreover, usually, it has no impact on the grades, while being more engaging and improving knowledge retention.\nWhat is a test?\nA test is a common and widely-used type of assessment that focuses on certain aspects of a course or module, has from 15 to 70 questions that can take up to 1 hour, and is given a grade for its completion typically.\nThe test aims to reflect the materials covered in a section and module or even lessons on a specific subject. Due to their size and relevance, they often are the metric showing whether a learner understands the topic or should revise certain parts or lessons of the module. Thus, they constitute a significant part of grades, if talking about academic institutions.\n- When to apply? Tests are a final checkpoint to include before jumping to a new concept, topic, or module. Therefore, use it after the module, series of lessons, or a large and complicated topic.\n- Format of questions: Because of covering a bigger amount of materials, it usually offers more variety and may include essay and open-ended questions in addition to standard multiple choice and true/false questions. Besides, multimedia and parts of materials can be used in text as well.\nWhat is the difference between a test and a quiz? The test is larger in scope, offering more questions and bringing more variety to knowledge assessment after the module or section, while the quiz is shorter and used after a lesson.\nWhat is an exam?\nAn exam is a comprehensive instrument to measure students\u2019 understanding of the system of knowledge and skills upon completing a course or one of the course milestones, taking typically at least 40 minutes of the student\u2019s time.\nThe exam's main purpose is to evaluate whether the student has acquired a system of knowledge that allows him to proceed further with the learning or confirms that he fully understands and can apply. That\u2019s why completing an exam is the key to passing the whole course.\n- When to apply? Due to their comprehensive nature, exams are often included at the end of midterms (if talking about academic intuitions), blocks of modules around specific subjects, complex topics, or the whole course.\n- Format of questions: As they aim to assess the system of knowledge, expect multiple-choice or true/false questions, they are likely to have open-ended questions regarding case studies, scenarios, and issues for a student to show how the knowledge can be applied.\nIn terms of test vs exam comparison, we can say that they often seem alike, especially when used together in courses. However, the main difference between exams and tests is the length and extensiveness. Thus, the exam is usually the final stop before course completion, while the test is a checkpoint before the next topic.\nWays to create quizzes and tests for online learning\nMany of us have a good understanding of what a test looks like. Apart from the fact that whole life is a test, we encountered plenty in school and university.\nYet, how do course creators, online tutors, and teachers integrate different assessment types in their online courses? Usually, they use an LMS, course creation software or a course editor, under which they have three options that allow crafting tests of various complexity.\nMethod #1: Everything starts with a quiz\nWell, most of the LMSs offer tools to create test and quiz assignments. However, the crucial part is their flexibility. For instance, for quiz and test applications, the easy quiz editor with single or multiple-choice and free-text options should be ideal for assessing knowledge after the lesson or webinar.\nSimplicity matters here, especially if you have different topics and want to leave room for the instructor\u2019s review.\nNote. That\u2019s what a proper quiz editor looks like, offering the aforementioned question types.\nMethod #2: A mix of questions brings you a test\nDeveloping a decent test requires diverse questions, a particular focus on ideas and analysis, and creativity. There, you may use a quiz approach, but make the questions and tasks more exciting, comprehensive, and deeper.\nWhy? Tests are more extensive and should evaluate student\u2019s knowledge on a more systematic level. Thus, the tool you are using should have room for various and multiple questions and engaging formats.\nNote. If the tool offers a decent editor, you can add pictures and links and define formatting for a better learning experience.\nMethod #3. Create a separate space for an exam or test\nFor a complicated and diverse test or comprehensive exam, you should use a specific solution or have different ways to compensate for it.\nWithin LMS, you can create a separate module for the exam, where in the content part you describe the structure, then use quizzes for testing and assignments for an analysis part with text or uploaded files.\nA good example of an engaging exam can be two 20-30-question tests followed by an assignment with a case study, analysis, or scenario.\nNote. Here is how you can use assignments to support your quiz, focusing on creating a case study to test the skills and knowledge application of your learners.\nOnline tools for quizzes and exams\nLastly, whether you assess students\u2019 knowledge within a blended learning program, online classroom, or online course, you should know of advanced solutions that can make your quiz and test options more engaging and diverse.\nWhat are they? Here is a list of TOP 5 that can make a difference.\n- #1. Kahoot: a learning platform that allows you to create games and interactive quizzes with multiple-choice, true/false, and open-ended questions and puzzles. You can use it with your presentations to make learning more engaging.\n- #2. Quizizz: a user-friendly platform for making and creating assignments and quizzes with more than 18 question types, supporting media, and offering reports and leaderboards. It can add to classroom engagement.\n- #3. Quizlet: a learning tool that offers gaming, quiz, and teaching options, allowing you to create flashcards, tests, and study sets. Importantly, it provides AI support and sets for various subjects, from specific exams to biology.\n- #4. Aha Slides: an interactive presentation tool where you can create quizzes and open-ended questions.\n- #5. Google Forms: a classic Google Apps option that allows you to create quizzes, polls, and tests online. It is a free and effective solution, especially if you rely on Google Suite for your business or learning.\nConclusion: There is a difference between a quiz and a test\nAll in all, distinguishing between quizzes, tests, and exams is crucial for assessing learners' knowledge. How do they differ? Quizzes are brief and informal, providing quick insights without a major impact on grades. Tests, being more comprehensive, play a significant role in determining grades and identifying areas for improvement. Exams are the most extensive, evaluating systematic knowledge and being crucial for course completion.\nNotably, to assess the skills and knowledge of students online, you will likely need LMS course editor tools, where you have different options. At the same time, you can resort to tools like Kahoot, Quizziz, Quizlet, Aha Slides, and Google Forms to enhance online assessment by creating engaging quizzes, assignments, and exams.",

      "content": "Tests: Essays\nPreparation\nEssay or subjective exams may include either short answer questions or long general questions. These exams have no one specific answer per student. They are usually scored on an opinion basis, although there will be certain facts and understanding expected in the answer. The main reason students fail essay tests is not because they cannot write, but because they fail to answer the questions fully and specifically, and because their answer is not well organized.\nEssay exams require recall learning. Carefully figure out the major content areas to learn. If you are not caught up, this is not a time to read everything in a frantic manner. Focus on the key source for the test: notes or textbook, or whatever you think will be most heavily covered on the test. It's better to understand and know a few things very well than to have a large quantity of unorganized, poorly learned material. These suggestions may help:\n- List all topics sure to be included on the test. List important subtopics for each.\n- Skim all the materials to be covered, checking those to be more intensively studied.\n- Write down all the key topics covered in class and in your reading up until the test date (probably about 5 or 6 topics at mid-quarter and 9 or 10 at finals).\n- Read or reread all materials not understood; use a specific purpose when reading.\n- Develop a pool of information for each topic. Answering words like \"who,\" \"what,\" \"where located,\" \"how works,\" \"key characteristics, \" \"cause-effect,\" and \"examples\" for each topic will help to cover the critical information.\n- Finally, take 2-3 blue books to class and a mechanical pencil that won't need sharpening. If the instructor specifies ink, take a pen with erasable ink.\nTaking the Essay Test\n- Read all the directions and questions.\n- Note the number of items, point distribution, range of difficulty, and time available.\n- Jot down any immediate answers that come to your mind - lists, outlines, etc. Jot down any other key information you might forget.\n- Analyze the test question and divide it into its main parts and subparts, and quickly construct a rough outline.\n- From the parts quickly construct a rough outline.\n- Note the instructional words included in the question, e.g., compare or contrast.\n- Use the outline as a \"map\" to answer the essay question. If you don't have time to finish the whole test, this outline may give you some points. More importantly, the outline helps you to stay focused.\n- Make your answer as specific as possible.\n- If you know the answer, write only what you are asked.\n- Avoid generalities.\n- Use part of the test question in your test answer at the beginning of the paragraph. This signals to the reader that you are answering this part of the essay here! This will earn you points.\n- Include an introductory statement at the beginning and a summary paragraph at the end.\n- Review your answers. Your essay is written under the intensity of a deadline, but it is graded under much more relaxed conditions. Allow sufficient time to check for spelling, grammar, omitted words, incorrect dates, etc. This is when you will be glad you wrote in pencil.\nA Glossary of Essay Test Words\nANALYZE: When asked to analyze, separate (a thing, idea, etc.) into its parts to find out their nature, proportion, function, interrelationship, etc.\nCOMMENT: When asked to comment, you are asked to explore the impact and meaning of something; give a note in explanation, criticism, or illustration of something written or said; remark or make an observation made in criticism or as an expression of opinion\nCOMPARE: Examine qualities or characteristics in order to discover resemblance's. The term compare is usually stated as compare with, and it implies that you are to emphasize similarities, although differences may be mentioned.\nCONTRAST: Tell how two or more topics are different from associated things, qualities, or events, etc.\nCRITICIZE, INTERPRET, and REVIEW: Express your judgment with respect to the correctness or merits of the factors under consideration. Give the results of your own analysis and discuss the limitations and good points or contributions of the plan or work in question.\nDEFINE: Definitions call for concise, clear, authoritative meanings. Details are not required, but boundaries or limitations of the definition should be cited. Keep in mind the class to which a thing belongs and whatever differentiates the particular object from all others in the class.\nDIAGRAM, and ILLUSTRATE: Present a drawing chart, plan, or graphic representation in your answer. You may be expected to label the diagram or add a brief explanation or description.\nDISCUSS: Examine, analyze carefully, and present detailed considerations pro and con regarding the problems or items involved. Often found in essays.\nEVALUATE: Present a careful appraisal of the problem, stressing both advantages and limitations. Evaluation implies authoritative and, to a lesser degree, personal appraisal of both contributions and limitations\nEXPLAIN, RELATE: Clarify and interpret the material you present. State the \"how\" or \"why,\" reconcile differences in opinion or experimental results, and state causes if possible. In brief, tell how it all happened.\nJUSTIFY, PROVE: To justify your answer, provide factual evidence or logical reasons. In such an answer, evidence should be presented in convincing form. Establish your answer with certainty by evaluating and citing experimental evidence or by logical reasoning.\nLIST, ENUMERATE: Present an itemized series or tabulation. Be concise.\nOUTLINE: Give main points and essential supplementary materials, omitting minor details, and present the information in a systematic arrangement or classification.\nSUMMARIZE: Give the main points or facts in condensed form. Omit details, illustrations and examples.\nTRACE: Give a description of progress, historical sequence, or development from the point of origin. Such narratives may call for probing or deductions.\nWorks Cited\nDeese, James and Ellin K. Deese. How To Study (3rd ed). New York: McGraw-Hill, Inc., 1979.\nExamination Skills and Techniques.
