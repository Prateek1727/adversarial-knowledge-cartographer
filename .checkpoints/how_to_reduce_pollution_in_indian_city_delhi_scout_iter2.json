      "content": "10 Tips to Survive Delhi's Air Pollution\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nEvery November, Delhi transforms into a smoggy haze, with its air quality plunging to alarmingly poor levels. If you're a Delhiite, you probably have a love-hate relationship with the city this time of year. With the Air Quality Index (AQI) inching towards the dreaded \"severe plus\" levels, stepping outside feels like entering a smoke chamber.\nOn Monday, November 18, the AQI touched an alarming 494, dangerously close to hazardous levels, as per the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). PM2.5 levels surged to 354 \u00b5g/m\u00b3\u2014more than 20 times the WHO's standard\u2014while PM10 levels were 12 times the safe limit. If you're in Delhi or nearby cities like Gurgaon or Noida, you're likely wondering: how can we stay safe? This guide will tell you everything you need to know!\nWhat Is Causing Rising Air Pollution Levels in Delhi?\nDelhi\u2019s air pollution crisis is the result of a variety of factors that worsen during the winter months. While pollution is a year-round concern, certain seasonal contributors make the situation unbearable between October and December.\nVehicular Emissions: With over 11 million registered vehicles and an annual growth rate of 9.7%, vehicular pollution is one of the biggest culprits. Cars, trucks, and two-wheelers contribute a staggering 40% of Delhi\u2019s air pollution, releasing harmful gases like nitrogen oxides and particulate matter into the atmosphere.\nStubble Burning: Each year, agricultural stubble burning in neighboring states like Punjab and Haryana contributes significantly to Delhi\u2019s smog. Farmers burn crop residues to prepare fields for the next planting season, releasing enormous amounts of PM2.5 and PM10 into the air. This, combined with Delhi\u2019s geographical location, traps pollutants in the city.\nConstruction Activities: Construction dust adds another layer to the crisis. Despite bans during high-pollution periods, poor regulation and enforcement often allow these activities to continue, releasing large quantities of particulate matter into the air.\nIndustrial Emissions: Factories and industrial units in and around the NCR emit pollutants, including sulfur dioxide and fine particulate matter. Unregulated operations and outdated technology make them a significant contributor.\nFestive Fireworks: While efforts to curb Diwali fireworks are in place, they still contribute to short-term spikes in air pollution levels.\n10 Tips to Survive Delhi\u2019s Air Pollution\nHere\u2019s a friendly guide to help you and your loved ones tackle the city's toxic air without losing your mind.\n1. Mask Up, the Right Way\nNot all masks are created equal. When the average PM2.5 level is 354 micrograms per cubic meter\u201420 times above WHO\u2019s recommended standard\u2014it\u2019s time to say goodbye to those flimsy cloth masks. Opt for N95 or N99 masks, which filter out up to 99% of fine particulate matter. If you're outdoors often, invest in a reusable mask with changeable filters.\nPro Tip: Change your mask filters regularly. Clogged filters can make breathing harder and reduce effectiveness.\n2. Purify Your Indoors\nGiven that the Delhi government recently announced a work-from-home mode for 50% of its employees, chances are you\u2019ll be spending more time indoors. But are your four walls as safe as you think? Indoor air can be up to five times more polluted than outdoor air. Invest in a good air purifier with a HEPA filter to tackle particulate matter.\nQuick checklist for home air quality:\nSeal gaps in windows and doors to prevent outdoor air infiltration.\nAdd indoor plants like peace lilies and snake plants\u2014they can reduce certain toxins.\nUse a humidifier if the air feels dry, but don\u2019t overdo it; too much moisture can encourage mold.\n3. Avoid Peak Traffic Hours\nLet\u2019s face it, Delhi\u2019s traffic and pollution go hand in hand. The Centre for Science and Environment reported that vehicles contribute 26% of the city's air pollution. Gurgaon, which recorded an AQI of 402 recently, highlights how vehicular emissions worsen the crisis, especially with vehicle registrations growing at nearly 10% annually.\nIf you must venture out, avoid peak traffic hours when emissions are at their highest. Better yet, carpool, take public transport, or\u2014if your route allows\u2014bike to your destination. Every small step can make a big difference\n4. Mind Your Food Choices\nWhat you eat can strengthen your body\u2019s defense mechanisms. Pollution doesn\u2019t just affect your lungs; it compromises your immunity. Add antioxidant-rich foods like spinach, berries, and nuts to your diet. Citrus fruits like oranges and lemons are excellent for boosting Vitamin C levels, which help combat inflammation caused by pollutants.\nKitchen hacks for detox:\nDrink turmeric milk (haldi doodh) for its anti-inflammatory benefits.\nBrew ginger and tulsi tea\u2014it\u2019s a natural way to ease respiratory discomfort.\nInclude omega-3-rich foods like walnuts and flaxseeds for added protection.\n5. Know When to Exercise\nExercising is essential, but when the AQI hits hazardous levels, outdoor workouts can do more harm than good. Delhi's AQI is notoriously unpredictable, so check real-time updates before stepping out. Apps like AQI India or websites from the CPCB can be lifesavers.\nIf the air quality is poor (but not severe), opt for light exercises and avoid peak pollution hours (usually mornings). On severe days, switch to indoor workouts like yoga or pilates. YouTube has an endless supply of guided sessions to keep you moving without stepping out.\n6. Use Public Transport\nPublic transport isn\u2019t just eco-friendly; it can shield you from spending too much time outdoors. The Delhi Metro is an excellent alternative, offering cleaner and quicker travel. If driving is unavoidable, consider switching to an electric or hybrid vehicle. While the upfront cost might seem steep, it\u2019s an investment in both the environment and your health.\n7. Hydrate\nThe simplest yet most underrated tip: drink water. Pollution leads to dehydration and makes your body work overtime to flush out toxins. Water, along with herbal teas and fresh juices, can help detoxify your system. Aim for at least 8\u201310 glasses a day and avoid sugary drinks, which can add to inflammation.\n8. Keep Your Home Smoke-Free\nWith AQI levels spiking, adding any form of smoke\u2014be it from cigarettes, incense, or candles\u2014can exacerbate indoor pollution. Stick to non-scented candles or LED alternatives to set the mood without compromising air quality. If you\u2019re a smoker, consider this the perfect motivation to quit\u2014not just for yourself but for everyone sharing your space.\n9. Take Collective Action\nIndividual steps are crucial, but they must be paired with systemic change. The government has taken steps like banning construction activities and implementing work-from-home for half its employees. However, policies are only as effective as their enforcement.\nSpeak up about pollution control measures in your community:\nSupport initiatives like car-free zones or odd-even vehicle policies.\nEncourage local businesses to adopt green practices.\nEducate friends and family about the importance of sustainable living.\nRemember, the air we breathe is a shared resource, and collective action can amplify change.\n10. Be Prepared for the Long Haul\nWhile stronger winds brought some relief to Gurgaon on Tuesday, reducing its AQI from 469 to 402, we can\u2019t rely on nature alone. Effective long-term solutions require urban planning, emission controls, and investment in renewable energy. Until then, survival means staying informed and proactive.\nA Regional Perspective: How Are Neighboring Cities Coping?\nDelhi\u2019s pollution often extends its grip to nearby cities like Gurgaon, Noida, and Faridabad. Gurgaon\u2019s AQI remained in the \u2018severe\u2019 range for two consecutive days, with one area hitting 494 due to stagnant conditions and increasing emissions. In Noida and Faridabad, AQIs slightly improved but still hovered in the \u2018very poor\u2019 range, at 370 and 320, respectively.\nTo curb emissions, authorities have pushed for tighter regulations on vehicles and construction activities. However, the results will take time, urging residents to stay cautious and proactive.\nFinal Thoughts\nDelhi\u2019s pollution crisis is a wake-up call for all of us. With PM2.5 levels over 20 times the WHO limit and nearly half of Delhi's government employees working from home to curb emissions, the situation is dire but not hopeless. By taking practical steps, staying informed, and advocating for systemic change, we can all play a role in ensuring cleaner air. For now, stay indoors, mask up, and breathe easy!\nIf you or anybody you know are suffering from lung or breathing-related problems, consult an experienced pulmonologist as soon as possible!",

      "content": "About 80 per cent of the water supplied to households in India\u2019s capital, Delhi ends up as wastewater, some of which remains untreated, polluting the city\u2019s waterways and threatening the health and wellbeing of its residents. This metropolitan area, with its population of approximately 30 million, currently has 35 operational sewage treatment plants.\nIn December last year, the Indian government announced its plans to treat over 95 per cent of Delhi\u2019s wastewater by the end of 2022 - over four times the national average.\nTo support this initiative, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) launched the first-ever study of its kind to examine how Delhi, India\u2019s largest city, recycles its wastewater and how it can be done more efficiently.\nIt assessed the various technologies sewage treatment plants use for nutrient recovery and recycling for safe and sustainable re-use of wastewater in Delhi. These include activated sludge process (ASP), extended aeration (EA), moving bed biofilm reactor (MBBR), sequential batch reactor (SBR), or fluidized aerobic bed reactor (FAB) processes.\nThe UNEP study found that the MBBR system is the most suited to the situation in Delhi and should, where possible, be employed in new treatment plants.\nMBBR is a modern system invented in Norway that uses a combination of biological rather than only chemical or mechanical processes to treat the water and remove pollutants. But this system is not without its challenges, say experts.\n\"The adoption of MBBR technology for large sewage treatment plants is challenging as maintenance costs are large,\u201d said Sangeeta Bansal, a lead researcher on the project.\nThe study suggests that other systems, such as SBR, and ASP could also be used for larger sewage treatment plants.\nIn addition to mapping Delhi's current nutrient recovery, recycling and reuse practices against available treatment options, the study has developed an ecosystems health card to measure the water quality and assess the revival of selected water bodies in the city.\nSome forms of pollution cause an increase in minerals and nutrients in the water, a process known as eutrophication, which leads to increased plant life, including algae, but a decrease in the diversity of fish and bird life. Raw sewage and food waste are also rich in nutrients, notably reactive nitrogen compounds such as nitrates and ammonium compounds, which are converted into nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide.\nLake Najafgarh in Delhi is one example of a polluted waterway. Since 2011, the lake area has increased by eight per cent due to pollution. It feeds into the Yamuna River, which flows through the city and is one of the main tributaries of the Ganges River.\n\u201cSupporting water security by using treated wastewater for non-potable purposes like toilet flushing, car washing, construction, agriculture, and rejuvenating affected rivers and lakes, is vital for the city\u2019s sustainable development,\u201d said Riccardo Zennaro, a Programme Management Officer for wastewater at UNEP.\n\u201cIt can also improve access to clean tap water,\u201d he added. \u201cWastewater treatment supports the recycling and recovery of water and nutrients and is, therefore, critical for sustainable water and nutrient management, while preventing pollution. However, it needs significant improvement to meet Indian government environmental standards.\u201d\nA stakeholder engagement workshop is planned to inform local and national decision-makers and relevant authorities about the findings of the project and discuss the next steps in implementing the recommendations as well as possible follow-up actions.\nUNEP is supporting Member States and others to address issues such as pollution through the World Water Quality Alliance, the Global Partnership on Marine Litter, the Global Partnership on Nutrient Management and the Global Wastewater Initiative (GW\u00b2I). With GW\u00b2I partners, UNEP is working to highlight that wastewater is a resource that can boost water security and that low-cost alternative wastewater treatment systems can be a viable solution if conventional systems or upgrades are not feasible.\nFor more information, please contact Riccardo Zennaro: or Avantika Singh",

Thus, a large fraction of the pollution related to diesel generator sets that are used during blackouts could also be indirectly attributed to AC use. Improving grid reliability, while tightening the stringency of the A/C star rating programme administered by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE), can, thus, further mitigate air pollution. For example, Shah et al. (2016) finds that improving the A/C efficiency [...] coordinate policies related to air pollution is warranted. The mission should focus on developing regional scale plans for air quality improvement with yearly targets and integrate efforts across different Indian Ministries. Normally, it is assumed that local sources contribute most to the pollution levels in a city. This study finds that in house sources in Delhi contribute about 32% (10\u2013 65%) of the air pollution in Delhi, while NCR (National Capital Region) sources (other than Delhi) [...] There are several power plants in cities like Delhi that have switched from coal to gas, significantly reducing the total contribution of the power sector to air pollution. Strategies for improving energy security and reducing GHG emissions have also been developed, and are being implemented in India, with important co-benefits for reducing air pollution. Due to stringent actions, some cities like Ahmedabad have shown a 50% decline in PM10 levels from 2002 to 2012 (NAMP-CPCB data). Improved",

      "content": "UKCEH scientists are among those working to understand and improve poor air quality in the megacity of Delhi, India. Dr James Cash explains more about a recent study...\nDelhi is one of the most atmospherically polluted cities in the world and often features in 'record-breaking air pollution' headlines during this time of year (October to December). This is due to a potent combination of factors including stagnant winds, temperature inversions (which trap pollutants close to the surface), busy roads and plenty of emissions.\nAt UKCEH, in projects such as DelhiFlux, we have investigated what measures could help improve air quality and reduce the numbers of premature deaths linked to air pollution in Delhi, which were estimated to be ~54,000 in 2020.\nOur new study in Atmospheric Environment quantifies how effective the Indian government\u2019s mitigation strategies have been over recent years in reducing the smog. We observed that, at its worst, the biggest culprit of air-polluting particles came from burning activities inside, and outside, of the city.\nCrop residue burning following the rice harvest in the provinces surrounding Delhi between mid-October and mid-November is well known to be a major and re-occurring contributor to Delhi\u2019s air pollution. Our study has confirmed this, but also shows that open burning of waste and solid fuels is a significant contributor.\nThis suggests more needs to be done to incentivise farmers to reduce crop-residue burning, to improve waste management in Delhi, and provide access to cost effective alternative fuels.\nWe found that heavy goods vehicle (HGV) restrictions were also a major contributor to poor air quality during October to December. HGVs are the highest emitting vehicles in Delhi and are often restricted to entering the city during late evenings and early mornings with the intention of reducing human exposure to air pollutants and to reduce traffic congestion.\nDifficult decisions\nThe timing of these restrictions is unfortunate as it concentrates emissions during night-time when pollutants are trapped close to the ground, thus increasing surface concentrations. This begs the question of when should HGVs enter the city? The conditions are more favourable during the middle of the day for particles to disperse, so, why not move the restriction times to the middle of the day? Or, would this only move the problem and cause more air pollution due to traffic congestion?\nThese questions are yet to be answered but reflect the difficult decisions that policymakers make. It also highlights how big a role the meteorological conditions play in Delhi\u2019s air pollution.\nWhile much remains to be done, some mitigation policies have been very effective: our measurements suggest that the shutdown of two coal power stations in Delhi significantly reduced particles due to coal-combustion. There have also been increasingly effective vehicle emissions standards over the last decade that have helped to curb air pollution from traffic, despite a rapid increase in the number of registered vehicles.\nFor now, air quality in Delhi will likely remain poor until the end of November, particularly as we are approaching the week of Diwali, the festival of light, and if previous years are anything to go by, the magnificent firecracker displays will unfortunately only add to the pollution problem.\nJames Cash\nFor more information, view our open access publication: Response of organic aerosol to Delhi's pollution control measures over the period 2011\u20132018\n1 BBC, Nov 2023 Air pollution: Schools in Delhi shut as air quality levels reach 'severe'\n2 Indian Express, Nov 2023 Delhi air pollution updates",

      "title": "Solutions for pollution that flop every year in Delhi",
      "content": "The national capital is undergoing an annual, almost ritualistic, set of motions built around facing and outraging about pollution. A climate condition that begins to assert itself around Diwali and lasts till peak winters gets the political class and the commentariat agitated: the politician across the party divides feel it is their chance to be counted with the voter, while the commentariat is moved by the sight of a beloved city slowly falling into a dark abyss of smog.\nAcross party lines\u2014the National Capital Territory of Delhi has seen governments of all possible political formations ever since the Supreme Court shook the city transport system by banning diesel buses and forcing it on CNG fuel in 1998\u2014the political class seems to be more moved by the optics of action, be it as the government or as the opposition, than by grounded acts policy innovation and effective enforcement.\nHowever, the commentariat and the media have asserted constant pressure on the decision-makers to elicit measures to combat pollution that look good on paper, even if they fall short on the ground. The courts as oversight bodies have also played their part and arm-twisted the political class into action.\nDespite this dynamics and the global discourse on climate change putting ever more pressure on the government of the day, the fate of Delhi has not changed.\nAll solutions devised by the governments\u2014both at the Centre and in the city\u2014and creation of multi-agency regulatory bodies fall short of meeting expectations of Delhiites. As one begins to explore the reasons for these measures failing to translate into meaningful, sustained improvement of the city air, a complicated, and somewhat confused, picture of a tangle of implementation gaps, structural growth, regional spill-in, and mis-prioritisation emerges.\nCity loves its cars\nIt was not without a reason that the Supreme Court targeted polluting vehicles of the public transport in its first major order to fight air pollution in Delhi and nearby areas. Its other important order in this class included banning vehicles which are more than 15 years old in the petrol category and more than 10 years old in diesel from the city roads. Delhi has one of the highest vehicle density among metros in the country. It has been rightly blamed as the essential contributor of air pollution.\nAn equally strong vehicle density in the National Capital Region (NCR) towns, adjoining Delhi, add to further pressure on the city air.\nData from the System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), a collective of activists and development practitioners, suggests that there has been an increase of around 40 per cent in the volume of vehicles in the NCR in the last 10 years.\nThe government and judiciary\u2019s response to this cause of pollution, apart from the one mentioned above, is to encouraging private ownership of electric vehicles, moving the CNG fleet of public transport to electric buses, and expanding the Delhi Metro network within the city and connect them to Metro lines in the NCR towns. Every year when the AQI graph starts rising, the government also hauls up vehicles that ply without the mandatory Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates and enforce the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP).\nYet, as analyst Manoj Kumar of the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) warns, they produce little results because of poor implementation of what the government calls effective solutions. He says, \u201cThe PUC certificate directive, for example, also does not work. At PUC stations, you do not even have to start the engine of your vehicle to let the executive record its emission reading. They just take a photo and issue the certificate.\u201d\nKumar also makes the important point, which makes implementation of any measure impractical, that among all sources of Delhi\u2019s pollution \u201conly 50 per cent is from local sources, the remaining coming from the neighbouring NCR towns\u201d.\nIncreasingly, evidence is mounting that any gain the capital may obtain out of the policy push for greener vehicles is offset by a voluminous increase in the absolute number of vehicles that ply through the city. This situation can be compared to the composition of the national energy basket, where India has made impressive gains in adding the renewable component in the last decade but it continues to be one of the biggest emitter of greenhouse gases on account of the absolute consumption of fossil fuels rising every year.\nAs Gufran Beig, chair professor at National Institute of Advanced Studies and founder-director of SAFAR, notes: \u201cThe growth in the absolute number of vehicles is quite high. The progress made by the introduction of electric and cleaner vehicles is being nullified by the growth in the number of vehicles. Road infrastructure in the city has also not kept pace with the increase in vehicular volume. So, traffic jams have increased.\u201d\nAnother problem Delhi faces is that the share of commercial vehicles in the city may be low in its overall vehicle profile\u2014in 2022\u201323, the city had 2,65,739 commercial vehicles as opposed to 20,71,115 cars, according to the data published the Delhi government\u2014but they are a heavy contributor to Delhi\u2019s air pollution episodes. \u201cHeavy and low-duty commercial vehicles make up just two per cent of all vehicles in the city, but contribute to 20 per cent of all emissions,\u201d says Beig, underscoring that targeting high-emitters, rather than every vehicle, should have been the government\u2019s priority.\nTargeting air pollution caused by vehicles, therefore, is not likely to yield results in future as well, as no government has addressed the increase in number of vehicles or segregated monitoring of polluting vehicles as per their pollution profile. Then, there is the issue of cross-border ownership of vehicles that stops any government to develop an integrated approach to solve the problem as coordinating among different state governments that are often run by competing political interests becomes an impractical idea.\nDust that does not settle\nWhen the city plunges into a thick brown haze, dust often becomes a convenient scapegoat. Indeed, the government bodies have taken measures to control dust in the air, including sweeping and water-sprinkling, mandating dust-mitigation plans for construction projects, and increasing green-belt coverage.\nAbhishek Kar of the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), argues that Delhi \u201ccan cut air-quality impact from construction activities by half in three years through a focused plan, like upgrading its Construction & Demolition Waste portal with semi-automated alerts, strengthening recycling via procurement mandates and incentives, and requiring dust-mitigation plans for all new projects by 2028\u201d.\nBut, observers argue that government efforts in controlling dust misses the point, largely because many of these actions are short-term fixes and focus on larger particles (PM10) rather than the fine particles (PM2.5) that pose the worst health risks. As Beig sharply notes, \u201cMitigating dust pollution is a misplaced priority. We seem to be focusing too much on PM10. Dust contributes just 10 to 15 per cent towards PM2.5, compared to 40 to 50 per cent towards PM10.\u201d He adds that dust-mitigation is a quick-fix solution that lasts just 24 hours and water-sprinkling, anyway, does not help in settling PM2.5, and, in fact, \u201cmight help in multiplying it\u201d.\nCREA\u2019s Kumar argues that Delhi has way too many construction sites, which is a nightmare for any monitoring body. \u201cMoreover, few roads have pavements on both sides. When you have soil on both sides, water sprinklers and sweeping machines will only help for a few hours,\u201d he says, concurring with Beig.\nThe scale of construction in the city, its unpaved edges, the transient nature of soil accumulation, and lesser contribution to fine particulate matter mean that the visible \u201caction\u201d of sprinkling or sweeping, however politically correct they might be, masks the structural challenge in removing pollution.\nSo, while dust-control is necessary, over-emphasis on it, relative to other sources, and a shallow reach in targeting it reduce its impact.\nNeighbourhoods crop up seasonally\nIn news cycles each autumn, the burning of paddy residue in Punjab, Haryana, and western Uttar Pradesh receives heavy coverage as one of Delhi\u2019s major pollution triggers.\nSince plumes of smoke from stubble burning episodes can be seen in satellite imagery and plotted on state maps, they attract widespread attention and start trending on social media. During certain peak days of pollution episodes in Delhi, they do contribute sharply to Delhi\u2019s smog burden. The governments of Punjab and Haryana claim to have deployed over 2.5 lakh machines for crop residue management at 33,000 custom-hiring centres, while thermal plants of Delhi and other towns have been directed to adopt biomass co-firing in their fuel mix.\nHowever, Kumar brings a sobering perspective: \u201cWith regard to stubble-burning, the peak burning season is very short. Last year, its contribution to Delhi\u2019s pollution exceeded 30 per cent on just two days. On the remaining days, it was well below five per cent.\u201d The implication of this data is clear: while it may appear dramatic, the stubble-burning window is narrow. It cannot substitute for year-round emission control. Moreover, operational issues abound on the field, as machines may be available, but farmers lack incentives or the know-how to use them, and biomass co-firing faces \u201cnon-availability throughout the year\u201d, says Kumar.\nBeig adds another dimension to the waste-burning issue as a contributing factor to the city\u2019s pollution. He says, \u201cWhile stubble burning is acute during a short window, the broader issue of open-waste and biomass burning in urban/peri-urban areas remains more persistent and less addressed.\u201d In short, the pollution-combat narrative has, perhaps, over-focused on stubble as the culprit, instead of broader biomass/waste-burning sources as bigger structural contributors to air pollution.\nData crunch of industries\nIndustrial and power-generation emissions may no longer be the dominant, visibly filthy source in Delhi, but they remain significant. Regulators have long mandated emission norms, required large factories and power plants to install continuous-monitoring equipment, and, during smog episodes, invoked GRAP restrictions, such as curbs on high-pollution operations.\nHowever, the results again fall short. Kumar emphasises, \u201cMany industries do not send out emissions data, which should be uploaded to the Online Continuous Pollution Monitoring system. They must be penalised for the omission. If data is missing, we will not be able to determine the source of pollution.\u201d\nBeig points out that the formal sector industries are not that harmful. The major threat is from informal factories, which are not even registered and are unregulated. These are also growing quite fast.\nIt shows that while the government is busy chasing large industry, even if its footprint is low in the city, the problem lies with smaller units, which are scattered, informal, and are able to evade monitoring with ease. And, given the nature of these factories, it is futile to expect credible emission data from them, which makes the process of fine-tuning policy that much more difficult.\nAt the same time, a lot of these smaller units are located in Delhi\u2019s neighbourhood, which, in itself, was a policy decision to decongest Delhi and move factories away from the heart of the city. This led to multiplicity of authorities across states that track these units, making real-time monitoring of unregistered units a difficult task, resulting in industrial emissions in the city and its neighbourhood contributing significantly to Delhi\u2019s particulate load.\nCan the city breathe?\nObservers believe that the air pollution crisis is not merely about seasonal anomalies; rather, it is the consequence of systemic gaps. The path forward is clear, if governments can muster political will.\nAs Kumar emphasises, \u201cPeople\u2019s awareness helps in mitigating the crisis, but regulation and implementation must come from the government.\u201d It is not that Delhi is suffering from a lack of policy, because the broad contours of an environmental policy are in place.

      "content": "Unreliable data mask just how bad the air quality crisis is in India\nIndia\u2019s air-quality crisis is deepened by unreliable data\nNEW DELHI -- Recent remarks about pollution from two Indian officials have increased frustration among residents who say policymakers are unwilling to acknowledge the severity of India's air quality crisis.\nWhen Environment Minister Bhupender Yadav told Parliament earlier this month that India\u2019s capital, New Delhi, has seen 200 days with good air quality readings, pollution experts and opposition leaders said he chose a figure that overlooked the worst pollution months.\nA week later, Delhi Chief Minister Rekha Gupta said the air quality index \u2014 a measure of air pollution \u2014 was similar to a temperature reading and could be dealt with by spraying water. Crowds jeered her at a subsequent public event, shouting \u201cAQI\u201d in reference to the city's poor air quality readings.\nGupta had also greenlit a controversial cloud seeding program earlier this year, saying it could produce rain that would lower pollution \u2014 despite lack of evidence that the approach would work.\nResidents in New Delhi and surrounding areas engulfed in toxic smog over the last few months said these are just the latest examples of officials denying the severity of air quality problems.\n\u201cInstead of doing cloud seeding, I hope the government will wake up and take some real action,\u201d said Anita, a 73-year-old New Delhi resident who goes by only one name. \u201cIt\u2019s a shame.\"\nEnvironmentalists and data experts said India\u2019s air quality measurement standards are looser than in countries such as the United States, so moderate readings often mask dangerous pollution levels. India's government air quality standards are also less stringent than World Health Organization guidelines.\nExperts said these gaps can erode public trust, even as few residents fully grasp how harmful polluted air is.\nIndia\u2019s air quality is measured through a nationwide network of monitors and sensors, as well as satellite data.\nThe monitors collect robust data, but there are too few of them, said Ronak Sutaria, CEO of Respirer Living, which builds machines and software for air quality monitoring. He said that the system falls short of letting citizens know how polluted the air in their neighborhoods really is.\nIn 2019, India launched the National Clean Air Program, which set targets aiming to reduce pollution by up to 40% in 131 cities by 2026.\nThe program has seen relative success, providing millions of dollars for monitors and water-spraying machines to reduce dust generated from vehicles plying the roads, construction activity and winds that blow desert sand into the cities.\nHowever, air pollution experts said the program has done little to reduce pollution from carbon-spewing industries or vehicle emissions, which are among the biggest sources of dirty air. Other sources include the burning of crop stubble on farms, use of wood and cow dung as cooking fuel and burning of garbage.\nA 2024 report by the Centre for Science and Environment, a New Delhi-based think tank, found that 64% of funds under the program went toward reducing dust and only 12% to reducing pollution from vehicles and less than 1% to bringing down industrial air pollution.\n\u201cWe are making huge investments in air quality monitoring. And so when we are expanding, then it also becomes an imperative that we should be focusing on the quality,\u201d said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the think tank.\nA study last year by the medical journal Lancet linked long-term exposure to polluted air to 1.5 million additional deaths every year in India, compared to a scenario where the country would have met WHO standards.\nYet earlier this month, Prataprao Jadhav, India\u2019s junior health minister, said there is no conclusive data available in the country to establish a direct correlation of death or disease exclusively to air pollution.\nShweta Narayan, a campaign lead at the Global Climate and Health Alliance, said that air pollution is still not taken seriously as a public health issue.\n\u201cDeaths related to air pollution are not being counted. And the reason why it\u2019s not being counted is because there are no systematic mechanisms to do so,\u201d Narayan said.\nNarayan said pollution causes long-term health problems for everyone exposed, but that it's especially bad for pregnant women, the elderly and children.\n\u201cAs a consequence of exposure to air pollution, we see a lot of preterm births, miscarriages, low birth weight. Exposure at this stage has a lifelong consequence,\u201d she said.\nEarlier this month, New Delhi residents took to the streets to protest against dirty air and demand immediate government action in a relatively rare instance of public demonstrations.\n\u201cWe do not know whether ... citizens will be able to link air pollution to elections, but perhaps that\u2019s where India is moving toward,\u201d environmentalist Vimlendu Jha said in an interview. \u201cCitizens are fed up.\u201d\nJha said authorities are not being honest about the problem and that there is a lack of political will to address the issue.\n\u201cThere\u2019s more headline and image management than pollution management,\u201d he said, adding that the high levels of pollution have been treated as normal by political leaders.\n\u201cThe first thing that the government needs to do is to be honest about the problem that we have,\" he said. \"The right diagnosis is extremely critical.\u201d\nRegardless of whether policymakers act, the consequences of dirty air for the residents of India\u2019s capital are evident.\n\u201cEveryone feels the pollution. People are not able to work or even breathe,\u201d said Satish Sharma, a 60-year-old auto rickshaw driver.\nSharma said he has reduced his work hours as his health has deteriorated in the last few weeks because of the pollution.\n\u201cI want to tell the government to please do something about this pollution,\" he said. \"Otherwise, people will move away from here.\u201d\n___\nFollow Sibi Arasu on X at @sibi123.\n___\nArasu reported from Bengaluru, India.

      "title": "Project Breathe: Resolving Delhi's Pollution through Technolog...",
      "content": "Overview\nIndia has put forth unprecedented achievements in the last few years, where India has not just started moving forward, but leaping forward. The country's Ease of Doing Business ranking has jumped from 142 in 2015 to 77 in 2018; it has also developed the world's largest solar power plant and is the home of the largest R&D operations outside of the home country for some of the biggest technology companies globally. It is now time for India, to take the lead in another parameter \u2013 our environment.\nOver the past few years, the level of pollution in Delhi in the winter months has hit hazardous levels because of the high presence of fine particulate matter in the air. This pollution has resulted in nearly 15,000 people dying prematurely in 2016 alone in the city and has reduced the average life expectancy of the residents by over 6 years.\nTackling this problem cannot be achieved by trying to resolve a single source of pollution but through a strategic and consistent effort across all the sources.\nThrough this article, I wanted to highlight the various activities, which are contributing to this environmental condition of the city and the various technologies or innovations that can be used to tackle each source.\nCauses of Pollution\nUnfortunately, with the data currently available the percentage allocation of each of these sources to the total pollution is still debatable. However, each still has a significant impact on the air pollution of the city.\n-\nBurning of Paddy fields in Haryana and Punjab\nOver the past few years, there has been an increasing focus on the stubble burning that takes place in Punjab and Haryana during October that moves into Delhi and significantly deteriorates the air quality. However, while this has been a long-lasting practice of the farmers, it has only now resulted in a problem for Delhi due to certain policies that have been passed by Punjab and Haryana.\nPrior to 2009, paddy in these states was typically grown in early April and rice, being a 120-day crop, was then harvested in mid-August. During this time of the year, the wind direction in north India primarily moves north-west and hence moves away from Delhi.\nHowever, to prevent the depleting water table and desertification of the state, being caused by the heavy requirement of water for the cultivation of rice, the State Government passed a policy (Punjab Preservation of Subsoil Water Act) in 2009 mandating a minimum date to sow the seeds, to line up with the monsoon season and hence requiring less underground water. While 1kg of rice grown in early April required 4,500 litres of water, by lining this up with the monsoon season, this requirement reduced to 1,500 litres. Unfortunately, this delayed sowing of the paddy crops resulted in the harvesting taking place in the month of October, at which time the wind pattern changes from north-west to south-east and moves the particles from Punjab into Delhi.\nWhile the changes required from a policy perspective are debatable, we will focus on how to resolve the current situation.\n-\nVehicular Emissions\nIn 2017, the number of registered vehicles in the city stood at 10.5 mn, of which there are 3.1 mn registered cars and 6.6 mn registered motorcycles and scooters with the balance comprising of trucks, goods carriers, three-wheelers and buses. Additionally, there are out of city trucks, which constantly come to the city, some of those that are against the NGL's notification barring buses and trucks over 15 years from plying into the capital.\n-\nConstruction Dust and Factory Emissions\nDelhi is a city constantly re-developing itself, expanding and improving its infrastructure. However, the cost of this is the soot and cement (smaller particles) and grit and wood (larger particles) that are released into the environment.\nIn addition, there are a number of industries and plants at the outskirt of Delhi that release harmful emissions into the air.\n-\nDiwali Festive Season\nDuring the end of October and early November, not only does the burning of the paddy fields result in Delhi's environmental situation, but this time of year is when Diwali takes place. Despite active public campaigns and the courts intervening weeks prior to the festival, there continue to be sufficient patakas that are burst, which rapidly deteriorates the air quality. Unfortunately, the firework traders usually have already purchased their stock by the time the notification is put forth by the courts. There is a need to come up with a consistent and clear position on the ban of patakas so as to now even allow the purchase of the fireworks by the traders in the city.\nRoadmap to Clean Air\nDelhi's environment situation cannot be resolved by fixing a single source of the pollutants but through a coordinated exercise against every cause.\n-\nData of the Environmental Factors\nThe first step before fixing any problem requires the identification of it. While the causes of the pollution are largely understood; how each factor interacts with each other, what is the primary source of pollution in different areas within NCR along with understanding the impact of the different efforts which are being taken to tackle this issue requires in-depth statistical analysis.\nThere are multiple sensors across the city that measures environmental factors such as wind speed, direction, pollutants and toxins in the air. An integrated system that also provides details on the policy being implemented or efforts being taken, can be developed that publicly provides this information through an API in real time. This will enable researchers across the world to analyze the various factors and provide solutions to the real causes of the issue.\n-\nAI-Based Traffic Monitor\nWhile Delhi has passed certain notifications banning vehicles above a certain age from plying on the roads, there are still plenty of vehicles defying this. AI systems have already been developed and being utilized globally, which have the ability to read the license plate number of vehicles. Such a system integrated with the Department of Motor Vehicles database of RC's would enable officials in real time to keep track of the vehicles defying this policy and especially those entering the city.\nThe added benefit of this system is that with an automatic electronic record of each vehicle defying the cities policies, it should reduce the chances of corruption at the ground level.\n-\nMarket Visibility of Paddy Straw\nWhile there have been efforts by the neighbouring states to discourage farmers from burning their paddy straw, the majority of small farmers are helpless due to the costs associated with the collection and disposal of the straw.\na. Average paddy straw from 1 acre of land = 2 tonnes\nb. Cost of Utilizing a Harvester / machine to collect the straw from 1 acre of land = INR 3,000\nc. Total Amount of Rice Straw Burned in Punjab = 12 mn tonnes\nTo drastically change this prevailing practice, would require an economically viable opportunity, where the farmers not only can dispose of this straw without any cost but actually make money from it. There are few solutions, which can achieve this objective.\nFew IIT-D graduates have developed a technology, which can convert rice straw into pulp and further into biodegradable homeware. They will purchase paddy straw for INR 5,000/acre and then sell it to small entrepreneurs who would make it into the pulp. With a high margin end product, it would end up being an economically viable model for the farmer, the startup along with the entrepreneurs. Similar ventures need to be encouraged and incentivized.\nWhile plants that utilize paddy straw as fuel for creating energy are coming up in Punjab, it would take time, before it reaches the capacity of the supply of the straw. However, internationally there are a number of such plants which purchase the paddy straw for this purpose in addition to utilizing the straw for pulp. Prices for this straw can be seen on global platforms like Alibaba at over a $100/tonne. The collection and export of this straw would enable further business opportunities for the farmers and interested parties.\n-\nSmog Tower\nChina has already developed and been utilizing its smog tower in Xian, which is able to clean 10 mn cubic meters of air daily. Essentially, this device is an industrial size air purifier that is used to filter the particulate matter outside.\nThere are even few startups in India that are developing similar technologies to improve the air quality. One such startup, Kurin Systems have designed a 40x20 foot smog tower that will have the capacity to clean 32 mn cubic meters of air per day. These towers if strategically located at the borders of the city along with heavy traffic areas could bring down the particulate matter of the wind flow before it even enters the city.\n-\nUsing Artificial Intelligence to Sort Trash\nCurrently, there are four dumpsites in Delhi, spread over 70 acres and measuring 65 meters in height. In addition to the other causes of pollution, this growing epidemic is also a major environmental concern of the city. 3 of the sites, though declared as exhausted long time ago, are still used for dumping garbage. Currently, 10200 tons of solid waste is generated every day, of which 5,300 tons are disposed of through 3 waste to energy plants. There are 2 new plants with a capacity of 3,500 MT that is being set up along with a capacity expansion 1,500 of the existing facilities, which is expected to be completed by 2020. However, certain technologies, which are already being used by multiple countries globally can be used to reduce this trash and increase recycling.\nAI-based robots have already been developed, which are able to distinguish between different types of recyclable material from waste and separate them. This would assist in solving one of the biggest issues from the amount of trash that is generated \u2013 sorting. Example of this can be seen in the following video - 'AI robots Clarke Learn to Sort Trash'.\nCountries like Sweden have even perfected their waste to energy to systems, till a point where less than 1% of their waste actually ends up in a landfill. Additionally, due to the overcapacity of their waste to energy plants, Sweden has actually begun to import waste from other countries, resulting in a new revenue source for them.\n-\nConstruction\nConstruction of local infrastructure and private buildings is a constant in any major metropolitan city across the world. A growing demand for infrastructure coupled with the heavy usage of existing facilities requires construction to take place. It is estimated that 70% of the buildings that will exist in India by 2030, are yet to be built.\nHowever, by some estimates, this construction is one of the leading sources of pollution in the city, with very little policies in place to maintain certain environmental standards. Within the city, it is a common sight to see open piles of construction materials, construction sites, which have not been fenced off and trucks carrying these materials, which are also not covered.\nIn countries like Hong Kong, a netted mesh across the construction area can often be seen, this would reduce the amount of material, which is blown into the air. While some of the developers in Delhi, do follow these practices, more often than not, in an effort to save their margins these practices will be ignored unless mandated to follow.\n-\nCloud Seeding\nCloud seeding is the practice of creating artificial precipitation to take place by dispersing substances like salts into the air through aircraft. This technology is already being used by China, US, Israel, South Africa and Germany for years.\nPrecipitation would force the pollutants in the air to be brought onto the ground and hence improve the air quality. The CPCB along with researchers from IIT-K have been planning on conducting this within the city. Such practices should be quickly developed and become an institutionalized practice if the pollution levels cross certain levels\nIndia is a land of constant surprise, where through sheer will, people have the ability to achieve the unimaginable. Over the past few years, we have made rapid developments across ease of business, renewable energy, taxation, logistics and infrastructure. But it is now time, to take action and to show the world that the country has the ability to not only manage this pollution problem but in a similar manner, take leaps and bounds forward to improve it.\n- https://www.ndtv.com/delhi-news/delhis-air-pollution-has-caused-of-death-of-15-000-people-study-1883022\n- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/life-expectancy-drops-6-years-in-delhi-due-to-pollution-study/changetheair_show/52791697.cms\n- https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/punjabs-paddy-dilemma-44957\n- https://www.windfinder.com/windstatistics/delhi_indira_gandhi_airport\n- https://www.downtoearth.org.in/coverage/not-a-waste-until-wasted-40051\n- https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chandigarh/fear-of-fines-makes-farmers-discard-straw-on-roadsides/articleshow/66468138.cms\n- https://www.indiatimes.com/news/india/iit-delhi-graduates-have-found-a-solution-to-stubble-burning-and-it-s-cost-efficient-355898.html\n- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/small-biz/startups/newsbuzz/indias-own-smog-tower-may-help-combat-air-pollution/articleshow/66496696.cms?from=mdr\n- https://www.indiatoday.in/mail-today/story/delhi-garbage-mounds-a-legacy-problem-can-t-clear-trash-overnight-lg-tells-sc-1290835-2018-07-20\n- https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/raise-a-stink-delhi-s-garbage-mountain-grows-taller-year-after-deadly-cave-in/story-NYr98Q6X8XXUcbnE5Uh1rO.html\n- https://sweden.se/nature/the-swedish-recycling-revolution/\n- https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2017/feb/15/delhi-deadly-dust-how-construction-sites-choking-city\n- https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/pollution-heres-a-plan-to-wash-away-delhis-toxic-air/articleshow/66519036.cms",

      "content": "Can anything stop the toxic smog of New Delhi?\nNEW DELHI \u2013 A man blows cascades of bubbles near the India Gate in New Delhi, hoping to lure children, or at least their parents, to buy his bubble blowing kits. Visitors usually flock to see the giant arch, a war memorial, that towers over a sweeping pedestrian boulevard in the city center.\nBut on a recent November day, visitors are thin. There's not much to see: The India Gate is a hazy outline in gray, smudgy smog. Bubble blower Gajender Kohli shakes his head. The bad air is bad for business, he says, and it makes him feel rotten. \"It makes me sick. It makes the kids sick,\" he says.\nVisitor Prateek Dabhi says he can't wait to leave the city. He's on a leg-stretch stopover during a days-long bus trip to the Himalayas. \"We're already losing years of our life,\" he says, because of pollution in his hometown in southeast India. \"If we lived in this pollution, we'd lose even more.\"\nAir pollution is likely costing residents of New Delhi an average of about 12 years of life compared with their expected lifespan if the region met World Health Organization air quality standards, according to a September report by the Air Quality Life Index at the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.\nSituated in the worst-polluted area of South Asia, a sweeping plain straddling northern India and adjacent areas of neighboring Pakistan, New Delhi is considered the world's most polluted megacity. More than a half-billion residents make their homes in the region.\nNew Delhi's air pollution problem becomes acutely visible in cooler months, when the air settles and allows smog to build up. During these months, it is often hazardous to breathe. In November, many schools were shuttered for nearly two weeks so children and teachers could stay home and avoid the outdoors.\nNew Delhi officials have been trying for years to dent pollution levels, from incentivizing electric vehicle purchases to building a sprawling mass transit system. \"And yet, it's not enough at all,\" says clean air advocate Anumita Roychowdhury, the executive director of research and advocacy at the Centre for Science and Environment.\nRoychowdhury lists some of the efforts the New Delhi government has undertaken over some 20 years, from shuttering four coal power plants surrounding the city to ordering large industrial units to switch to less-polluting natural gas. The public bus fleet, which was switched over to natural gas, is now being swapped out for EVs.\nTo monitor air pollution levels, \u2013 and what kind of emissions are contributing to them, \u2014 the city has installed more than 40 real-time monitoring stations. Residents get cash back if they buy two- or three-wheeled EVs \u2013 scooters and rickshaws, which are the main ways people get around in New Delhi.\n\"As of today, roughly about 12% of the new vehicles sold in Delhi are electric vehicles,\" Roychowdhury says. \"These are not small measures. No other city in India has implemented all of them together like Delhi has.\"\nRoychowdhury says all those measures have bent the upward curve \u2013 but the city's efforts are \"overwhelmed, swamped and undercut simply by the sheer volume and numbers\" of growth and new pollution.\nWithin three years, New Delhi's population is expected to reach 39 million people \u2013 roughly the population of California, but a fraction of the size. New Delhi's sprawl extends so far that many residents don't actually live within city limits \u2013 they technically live in four neighboring states.\n\"The problem is not Delhi's. The problem is a regional problem,\" says Jasmine Shah of the Aam Aadami Party, which governs New Delhi. But, he adds, \"there is no coordinated action plan.\" Shah blames the rival, ruling federal governing party, the BJP, led by prime minister Narendra Modi. The same party also governs the states around New Delhi. \"They seem to be politicking about this matter all the time.\" BJP state and federal officials declined to comment for this story.\nRoychowdhury says surrounding state and federal governments are taking action, \"but it's not adding up.\" The federal government has made a series of moves, from strengthening fuel emissions standards and expanding renewable energy to providing incentives for electric vehicle sales. It provides extra cash to cities that reduce their air pollution, with mixed success.\nIn 2021, the government created a commission to help manage air quality in New Delhi and the surrounding regions. It can \"direct states to take very specific actions that reduce pollution,\" says Bhargav Krishna, an expert on air pollution and health. \"But it's chosen not to utilize the full range of its powers.\"\nArvind Nautiyal, a member of and spokesman for that commission, says they were employing a \"collaborative, consultative\" approach but were not sitting idle. For instance, he says the commission helped shut down some 7,800 industrial units that were using dirty fuels for power. He says there had been \"year-on-year, quite a significant difference\" in pollution levels.\nAlthough November had been a particularly bad month, Nautiyal says the New Delhi area has now had 206 days when the air pollution levels were just considered \"unhealthy\" \u2014 an improvement over previous years. \"There's a long way to go, a long journey ahead, but there has been consistent improvement,\" Nautiyal says.\nKrishna says the tepid support for cleaning up India's deadly air can be explained by the bind the country is in:. India is \"a developing country that rapidly needs to pull millions and millions of people out of poverty,\" he says. \"You need to rapidly industrialize ... You need to provide electricity to all of these households.\" In northern India, that is still done chiefly through coal. \"Air pollution is a really inconvenient problem to have,.\" Krishna says, and for now, \"it's seen as an elite issue.\"\nNew Delhi's experience underscores this perception. It is where elites \u2014 activists and the judiciary \u2014 have kept pressure on the local government to tackle the problem. Being the capital, it has also received more attention than other cities and regions.\nActivists say it's harder to mobilize people to pressure the government to do more because the most severe harm from air pollution isn't immediately noticeable. Some of the worst impacts come from the tiny particles in smog, known as PM2.5, about 30 times smaller than the diameter of a human hair.\nWhen you breathe them in, \"they can go into your bloodstream and all over your body and act as a toxin,\" says Christa Hasenkopf of the Energy Policy Institute. \"It causes strokes and heart attacks. It can cause even things like cognitive decline and certainly issues with fertility,\" Hasenkopf says. \"It's hard to viscerally understand and connect that someone's illness is caused by, or exacerbated by, pollution. I think that's made it very, very difficult to develop policy and enforce policies to get rid of it.\"\nSo New Delhi's residents keep paying the price. Take the children of Bhavreen Kandhari, a clean air activist: \"My children hadn't seen a blue sky,\" she says, until the pandemic halted industry and kept cars off the road in New Delhi.\nAt New Delhi's Safdarjung Hospital, Razia Begum waits for a doctor to see her three children, aged 10 years to 10 months. They've all got chesty coughs, she sighs. \"It could be the cold, or the pollution,\" Begum says. \"If the air was cleaner, my children wouldn't get so sick.\" For now, she says, the pollution keeps her running to the hospitals.\nOn a nearby busy road, 35-year-old Baljeet Singh says he's recently learned that pollution is a danger (many people assume it's a normal winter fog). He's about to get on a motorbike. He wraps a handkerchief around his face to protect him from pollution, which experts say can help but is not sufficient. He laughs and asks: \"Do you have a better idea?\"",
