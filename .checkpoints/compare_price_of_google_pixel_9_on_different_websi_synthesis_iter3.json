      "content": "Can you still buy the Google Pixel 9? Here's how much you'll have to pay\nForget Pixel 10, the Pixel 9 is still available if you really want it\nThe Google Pixel 10 may have just been unveiled, ahead of its August 28 launch, but is it the only option for potential Pixel hopefuls? After all, the Google Pixel 9 is only a year old, and typically older models enjoy some generous discounts once they hit that milestone.\nThen again some phones simply disappear from store shelves, as focus is shifted to the new model. So which fate has befallen the Google Pixel 9? Can you still buy last year's Google phone, and how much is it going to cost you compared to the Pixel 10?\nThe good news is that the Pixel 9 is still available to purchase, as are the Pixel 9 Pro and Pixel 9 Pro XL. The bad news is that the prices haven't actually changed \u2014 they essentially cost the same as their Pixel 10 counterparts.\nPixel 9 at Google Store\nIf anyone was going to discount the Pixel 9 series, you'd think Google would be it. But checking the Google Store and there don't seem to be any discounts on Pixel 9 series devices as of this writing. That means the Pixel 9 is going to set you back at least $799, which is the exact same price as the Pixel 10.\nAdmittedly, the Pixel 9 is available right away and there seems to be plenty of stock available in all colors and storage options. The Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL aren't quite as readily available, but as long as you're not picky about the color you get then all the different storage options are available.\nit may not be enjoying any discounts right now, but the Pixel 9 is still available to purchase at the Google Store. It's a tried-and-tested Google phone with a year's worth of updates and fixes under its belt already. This is far from the lowest price we've seen this phone go, and the more advanced Pixel 10 models go on sale August 28.\nAlso available: Pixel 9 Pro ($999) | Pixel 9 Pro XL ($1,099)\nThe Pixel 9 Pro still costs $999, the same as the Pixel 10 Pro, though the Pixel 9 Pro XL is $100 cheaper than its successor at $1,099. That lower price is due to the fact Google still sells the 9 Pro XL with 128GB of storage, which isn't the case for the Pixel 10 Pro XL and its 256GB base storage.\nPixel 9 at Amazon\nBeing the retail behemoth that it is, Amazon has a lot of different Pixel 9 options from a variety of sellers in various levels of condition \u2014 and it's not always obvious from the search menu whether you're looking at a new or refurbished model. For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to focus on devices that are brand new and unlocked.\nGet instant access to breaking news, the hottest reviews, great deals and helpful tips.\nAnyone hoping to pick up a Pixel 9 can get a $50 discount on the original $799 price tag \u2014 but only if they buy that phone in wintergreen. The black model has had no discount, and white is more expensive for some reason. Considering we've seen this phone drop as low as $499 in the past few weeks, I wouldn't recommend this deal at all.\nSave $180 on the cost of the Pixel 9 Pro XL over at Amazon. It's nowhere near the lowest price we've seen for this phone, it is still considerably cheaper than the Pixel 10 Pro XL \u2014 and it has all the best technology Google had to offer this time last year.\nThe Pixel 9 Pro is a little bit better off, with a $909 price tag for the black model \u2014 the other options are apparently sold out. Again, though, that's not an amazing deal. The Pixel 9 Pro XL is much better value, with the black model dropping to $929, but that's still almost $150 more than the lowest ever price.\nGoogle Pixel 9 at Best Buy\nThe good news is that the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are both available to purchase at Best Buy. The bad news is that they're both listed at full price, and you can only get the Pro in black. Pixel 9 buyers have a little more choice, since the wintergreen option is also available.\nFortunately the Pixel 9 Pro XL is both in stock and discounted to $989 \u2014 which actually makes it slightly cheaper than the smaller Pixel 9 Pro. But it's still a lot higher than this phone's all-time low.\nPixel 9 at Walmart\nWalmart is very much like Amazon, in that you're potentially buying from multiple sellers rather than Walmart itself. So there are a lot of used or refurbished Pixel 9 models listed for sale, which muddies things up slightly.\nSadly new and unlocked models appear to be out of stock across the entire Pixel 9 lineup. That means no Pixel 9, no Pixel 9 Pro and no Pixel 9 Pro XL.\nPixel 9 at AT&T\nThe Pixel 9 Pro XL is available at AT&T, though it appears the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro are unavailable. The former is out of stock, while the latter is apparently just not visible on the carrier's website.\nHowever those of you hunting for the XL have some caveats to contend with. The first being that AT&T is only stocking the 256GB model, and it costs the same amount as the Pixel 10 Pro XL. To make the Pixel 9 Pro XL even less appealing, the 10 Pro XL has a pre-order bonus that nets you the handset for free with any eligible trade-in.\nThat same deal isn't on offer for the 9 Pro XL \u2014 meaning you'll have to pay the full $1,249 price out of pocket.\nPixel 9 at T-Mobile\nAll 3 non-folding Pixel 9 devices appear to be out of stock at T-Mobile, not that it would have mattered. The three phones are all listed with the same price tags as their Pixel 10 counterparts \u2014 which is full retail.\nPixel 9 at Verizon\nThe only Pixel 9 option available at Verizon is a 128GB Pixel 9 Pro for $999 \u2014 and like the Ford Model T, it's only available in black.\nBoth the Pixel 9 and Pixel 9 Pro XL are listed as out of stock, with no colors or storage options available to order.\nShould you buy the Pixel 9 right now?\nThe question you may have right now is whether it's actually worth buying a Pixel 9, or Pixel 9 Pro, right now. Honestly, I would recommend against it for the time being. While stock levels do seem to be declining, being patient is far more likely to pay off.\nPixel 9s have been on sale a lot over the past 12 months, and those discounts were pushed to their extreme in the run-up to the Pixel 10 launch event. The Pixel 9 dropped below the cost of a full-price Pixel 9a, and in comparison the full $799 retail price seems like a complete rip-off. The same goes for the Pixel 9 Pro and 9 Pro XL, which have dropped their prices by several hundred dollars in the recent past.\nMy gut would tell me that, faced with the prospect of paying the same price for a Pixel 9 and Pixel 10, you're better off picking the newer phone. But we are at that weird point between the Pixel 10 announcement and its actual release, which means we don't really have a complete picture of how the new phone will perform until we do a full review.\nPlus, odds are we'll see retailers slashing prices to try and clear stock once the Pixel 10 is actually released on August 28. At which point you can better decide whether you want to pay out for the latest model, or save some money with last year's (admittedly very good) tech.\nMore from Tom's Guide\n- Pixelsnap is the Pixel 10 upgrade everyone should be the most excited about \u2014 here's why\n- Google Pixel 10 Pro has a hidden display upgrade that could save you a headache\n- The Google Pixel 10 will let you share your location through satellite \u2014 here\u2019s what we know\nTom is the Tom's Guide's UK Phones Editor, tackling the latest smartphone news and vocally expressing his opinions about upcoming features or changes.

Add CNET as a preferred Google source.\nBest Pixel 10, 10 Pro and 10 Pro XL deals\nThe Pixel 10 lineup builds on its predecessor, the Pixel 9, with a better design, smarter capabilities and new tools. It comes in multiple color options, offers a bigger 4,970-mAh battery and flaunts a brighter screen. Google has packed it with three rear cameras, putting it in direct competition with Samsung's Galaxy S25.\nThe Pixel 10 costs $799, the Pixel 10 Pro costs $999 and the Pixel 10 Pro XL costs $1,199. If you're looking for a phone that doubles as a tablet, the Pixel 10 Pro Fold starts at $1,799. They are all available for purchase at most retailers and carriers.\nGoogle is offering its regular Pixel 10 series phone for $200 off, and the Pixel Pro, Pro XL and Pixel fold for up to $300 off. If you purchase a Google Pixel 10 series phone and sign up with Google Fi, you can get up to $800 back in total. And if trade in your old phone, you can get up to $700 off. Just keep in mind that that is for newer devices, so your device could earn less. You can use Google's tool to get an estimated value.\nSigning up for a new line can get you the Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL for free. You will need to subscribe to an Unlimited phone plan to snag the offer. If you're already a customer you can save up to $1,100 with trade-in when you upgrade to the Unlimited Ultimate plan.\nAdding a new line on a qualifying plan can score you the Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro for free. Or you can get up to $1,000 off a Pixel 10, Pixel 10 Pro or Pixel 10 Pro XL with a trade on Experience Beyond and More of Go5G Next and Plus plans. You can also get $600 off with a new line on most other plans or $500 off with an eligible trade-in on most plans.\nThe basic Pixel 10 is available for just $8 a month -- that's $560 in savings with an eligible unlimited plan. Those looking to trade in their old device will enjoy up to $1,250 in savings on the Pixel 10 Pro and Pixel 10 Pro XL, making both free.\nXfinity is offering $400 off all available Pixel 10 models without trade-in. Trading in your old device can score you up to $830 in savings.\nTrading in an old phone at Best Buy can get you up to $725 off a new Pixel 10 series phone. You can also save an additional $100 if you sign up for Verizon or AT&T during the purchase.\nPurchasing a phone and plan through Mint Mobile can get some fairly large straightforward discounts right now. If you're after the 10 Pro XL you can save $700. The 10 Pro is currently $475 off, and the 10 is $450 off. These prices also include one year of unlimited service.\nSpectrum is offering the Pixel 10 Pro Fold for up to $350 off. You can also grab the Pixel 10 Pro XL for $400 off, the Pixel 10 Pro for $300 off and the regular Pixel 10 for $200 off. Plus you can get an instant $100 off when you trade in a phone and purchase this device.\nBest Pixel 9, 9 Pro, 9 Pro XL and 9 Pro Fold deals\nThe Pixel 9 series comes with a sleek design and is jam-packed with AI features. Generative AI pops up in many places, like the weather app and the all-new image-generation app. The design features flat edges and a defined camera bar.\nAt an impressive 6.8 inches, it gives you plenty of room to work and play. The Pixel 9 retails for $799, the 9 Pro costs $999, the 9 Pro XL model costs $1,099 and the 9 Pro Fold costs $1,799.\nGoogle is currently offering $300 off on the Pixel 9 and $350 off on the Pixel 9 Pro and Pro XL. Or you can sign up with Verizon or AT&T for more configuration options. And with an eligible trade-in, you can save up to $620.\nRight now, there are some third-party sellers on Best Buy offering new Pixel 9 phones. The retailer also has certified refurbished and open-box models for even less.\nCustomers on an Unlimited Plus plan who either add a line or upgrade an existing one at Xfinity will get $400 off all Pixel 9 models instantly, or up to $830 off with an eligible trade-in.\nYou can get $400 off the Pixel 9 Pro right now without trade-in. Or score $100 off with an eligible trade-in on the base Pixel 9 or Pixel 9 Pro. If you're looking to get the Pixel 9 Pro XL you could potentially also save with an eligible trade-in.\nBest Pixel 9A deals\nWe're expecting a Pixel 10A next year, but until then, Pixel 9A is the latest model in Google's budget-friendly A-series lineup and a pretty incredible value at just $499 -- matching, or even exceeding, the main Pixel 9 in some categories.\nIt has a more substantial battery (although slower charging) and features the same Tensor G4 chipset as the 9, which means it also supports Gemini AI features. It also features the same screen as the basic Pixel 9, with a 6.3-inch OLED display and 2,700 nits of brightness. You're sacrificing a bit of memory at just 8GB of RAM, along with some image resolution on the rear camera. You can get all the details in our full breakdown.\nGoogle isn't offering any direct discounts at the moment, but if you're looking to join Google Fi, new customers will get $499 back in bill credits, which will net you the basic 128GB model free. Google also has its own trade-in program that can save you up to $625 in exchange for your old phone, which could also get you a free Pixel 9A, although remember that the best trade-in prices are paid for more recent phones.\nIf you want an unlocked Pixel 9A, you can save $100 right now, which brings it down to $399.\nAT&T is offering a generous $304 discount on the new Pixel 9A when you purchase the phone on an installment plan, which drops the price to just $6 per month. There's no trade-in required, but you can exchange your old phone for even more savings. Discounts are applied as bill credits over 36 months. If you're looking to switch, AT&T is offering up to $800 to pay off your phone.\nT-Mobile is offering multiple ways to get this new Google phone free. Adding a line on most plans will save you $600, which gets you either the 128GB or 256GB model free. You can also save up to $500 with an eligible trade-in, which still gets you the basic 128GB model free.\nMint Mobile has knocked $300 off the Pixel 9A for a limited time, which is an excellent offer if you don't have an old phone to trade in or want to activate a line of service. Those switching an existing number over to Mint Mobile can also get a year of unlimited data for just $15 monthly, which is 50% off the usual price. The 9A is currently out of stock, so it's worth keeping an eye for when it's restocked.\nPixel 8 and 8 Pro deals\nReleased in late 2023, the Pixel 8 and 8 Pro are now two generations old. They feature a next-gen Tensor G3 processor, convenient AI features and improved screens. Right now, these models -- and deals on them -- are a little scarce.\nYou can save hundreds when you trade in your old phone. Discounts will vary depending on your device's year, condition and configuration. More recent devices, like an iPhone 16 Pro Max, will net about $580, but switching from that to a Pixel 8 will be a bit of a downgrade. You'd be looking closer to the $200 mark for something from a few years ago.\nJust note that the unlocked version of this phone is out of stock, so you'll need to choose Verizon as your carrier to get this phone.\nWhat is the best Pixel deal right now?\nIf you're looking to get the most bang for your buck, Google's deals on the Pixel 9A are a good value. You can save with an eligible trade-in; the savings will depend on the device you hand over. Plus, new Google Fi customers can pick up the basic 128GB model free without the need to trade in a device.\nPixel Fold deals\nThe Pixel Fold was Google's first foldable device and it's the predecessor to the Pixel 9 Pro Fold. It features a 5.8-inch cover screen, a 7.6-inch OLED internal screen, 12GB of RAM, a Tensor G2 processor and an intimidating $1,799 starting price. It's getting pretty tough to find these original foldables in stock -- especially with a new model on the shelves. Right now, there aren't a lot of deals but you might find a refurbished model at a decent price.\nHow we choose Pixel deals at CNET\nMany of us here at CNET have covered deals on top tech for more than five years, including cell phone deals from major brands like Apple, Google, Samsung and OnePlus. In that time, we've learned how to spot the best deals from trustworthy retailers and carriers to simplify the phone buying process.

This presents a pretty volatile situation in which the Pixel 9 is going to be hard to find, but any remaining units should also be pretty cheap.

The Google Pixel 9 Pro starts at $999 for the 128GB version, and there's also a more-expensive 1TB version if you need additional storage.\nGoogle Pixel 9 Pro XL deals\nProbably the most surprising smartphone announced during Made by Google 2024, the Google Pixel 9 Pro XL picks up where Google left off with the Pixel 4 XL years ago. It's essentially a bigger version of the Pixel 9 Pro, with a 6.8-inch LTPO display, 16GB of RAM, and a slightly larger battery. The XL phone starts at $1,099 for the 128GB version, or you could go up to 1TB to get more storage.\nAmazon: get $200 off the Pixel 9 Pro XL\nFor a limited time, if you buy the 6.8-inch Pixel 9 Pro XL from Amazon you'll get a straight $100 knocked off your purchase.

This suggests that the topic is complex and multifaceted, with various sources providing different information.\n\n**The Battleground:**\n\nOur research identified 8 battleground topics where sources disagreed on the price of the Google Pixel 9. These conflicts can be categorized into three main areas:\n\n1. **Price Variations:** Sources disagreed on the price of the Google Pixel 9, with some listing it as low as $299 and others as high as $799. This discrepancy may be due to different pricing strategies, promotions, or sales.\n2. **Availability and Pricing:** Some sources listed the Pixel 9 as available for purchase, while others mentioned different prices or unavailability. This conflict may arise from differences in data collection methods, timeframes, or sources.\n3. **Model Variations:** Sources disagreed on the price of the Google Pixel 9a, with some listing it as $499 and others as $349. This discrepancy may be due to different models, storage capacities, or configurations.\n\n**The Verdict:**\n\nBased on source credibility (domain authority, citation count), we can analyze each battleground topic to determine which side is more likely correct.\n\n1. **Price of Google Pixel 9:**\n\t* Side A (Swappa: $304) has a credibility score of 0.54, while Side B (Amazon: $799) has a credibility score of 0.54. Given the conflicting information, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n2. **Price of Google Pixel 9a:**\n\t* Side A (PCMag: $499) has a credibility score of 0.54, while Side B (US Mobile: $299) has a credibility score of 0.54. Again, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n3. **Availability of Google Pixel 9:**\n\t* Tom's Guide lists the Pixel 9 as available for purchase, while PCMag lists it as available but with a different price. Given the conflicting information, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n4. **Price of Google Pixel 9:**\n\t* Swappa lists the price as $304, while Google Store lists it as $799. Given the conflicting information, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n5. **Price of Google Pixel 9a:**\n\t* PCMag lists the price as $499, while US Mobile lists it as $299. Given the conflicting information, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n6. **Price of Google Pixel 10:**\n\t* CNET lists the price as $799, while US Mobile lists it as $349. Given the conflicting information, we cannot determine which side is correct with confidence.\n\n**Actionable Insights:**\n\nBased on our research, we can provide the following actionable insights:\n\n1. **Verify Pricing:** Before making a purchase, verify the price of the Google Pixel 9 on multiple websites to ensure accuracy.\n2. **Check Availability:** Confirm the availability of the Google Pixel 9 on various websites to avoid disappointment.\n3. **Consider Model Variations:** Be aware of different models, storage capacities, or configurations that may affect pricing.\n4. **Evaluate Source Credibility:** Assess the credibility of sources providing pricing information to ensure accuracy.\n\nBy considering these insights, consumers can make informed decisions when comparing the price of the Google Pixel 9 on different websites.\n\n---\n\n## Knowledge Graph (JSON)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"entities\": [\n    \"Google Pixel 9\",\n    \"Google Pixel 10 Pro\",\n
