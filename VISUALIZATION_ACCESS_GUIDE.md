# 🎯 How to Access Visualization Features

## ✅ FIXED: TypeScript Compilation Error Resolved

The TypeScript compilation error has been fixed by updating the GraphNode interface to support conflict-specific properties.

## Quick Start - Demo Mode

The **easiest way** to see the visualization buttons immediately:

1. **Open your browser** and go to: http://localhost:3000
2. **Click the purple "🎯 Load Demo Data (Coffee Health Research)" button** 
3. **Visualization buttons will appear instantly** in the header:
   - 📊 **2D Graph** - Traditional React Flow visualization
   - 🌐 **3D Graph** - Advanced Three.js 3D visualization  
   - 📈 **Analytics** - Interactive dashboard with charts

## Full Research Mode

To run actual AI research and see real data:

1. **Go to**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Enter a research topic** (e.g., "Is coffee good for health?")
3. **Click "🚀 Start Research"** 
4. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for the AI agents to complete the research
5. **Visualization buttons appear** once research is complete

## What You Can Do

### 2D Graph Mode (📊)
- **Interactive node-link diagram** using React Flow
- **Click nodes** to see details and citations
- **Zoom and pan** to explore the graph
- **Color-coded edges**: Green (support), Red (refute), Gray (neutral)

### 3D Graph Mode (🌐)
- **Immersive 3D visualization** with Three.js
- **Physics simulation** with force-directed layout
- **Particle trails** showing relationship flows
- **Orbit camera controls** (mouse to rotate, scroll to zoom)
- **Floating information panels** on node selection

### Analytics Dashboard (📈)
- **Interactive charts** showing graph metrics
- **Real-time statistics** (node count, edge count, conflicts)
- **Graph evolution timeline** across research iterations
- **Export functionality** for data and visualizations

## Additional Features

- **📄 Report Button**: View the full research synthesis report
- **🔍 Fullscreen Mode**: Immersive full-screen visualization
- **💾 Export Options**: Download data as JSON, CSV, or PDF
- **🔍 Search & Filter**: Find specific entities and relationships (in 3D mode)

## System Status

✅ **Backend API**: Running on http://localhost:8000  
✅ **Frontend**: Running on http://localhost:3000  
✅ **LLM Model**: `llama-3.1-8b-instant` (Groq)  
✅ **Search API**: Tavily (1000 free searches/month)  

## Troubleshooting

If visualization buttons don't appear:
1. **Check that research completed successfully** (status shows "completed")
2. **Try the demo mode first** to verify the UI is working
3. **Refresh the page** if needed
4. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors

## Example Research Topics

Try these topics for interesting visualizations:
- "Is coffee good for health?"
- "Nuclear energy safety"  
- "Remote work effectiveness"
- "Cryptocurrency investment risks"
- "Climate change causes"
- "Artificial intelligence ethics"
